{{TankData|Tank= AMX 50 Foch B

| Replaced [[Tank:AMX_50Fosh_155|Foch 155]] in 9. F64 AMX 50Fosh B 20 patch, the '''AMX 50 Foch B''' is basically Foch 155 with rapid-fire autoloader gun. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  It sacrifice its alpha damage and penetration in favor of high burst damage, high DPM, and accuracy. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  resulting to insane damage per clip at 2400+, close to the monstrosity damage per clip of [[Tank:G98_Waffentrager_E100|Waffentrager E 100]]. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  It still suffers some of problems with Foch 155, however. F64 AMX 50Fosh B

|InTheGame_pros= 

- High accuracy and shell velocity allow efficient sniping

- Incredible 2,400 burst damage distributed among 6 shells with quick intra-clip reload and acceptable full clip reload time

- Tough front armor, thick and sloped

- Good top speed and respectable weight make potential rammer against medium or light tanks 

- Shock factor like the previous [[Tank:G98_Waffentrager_E100|WT E 100]] due to clip potential, enemy tanks may panic upon sighting you

|InTheGame_cons= 

- 2nd worst alpha damage and worst penetration on both standard and premium ammunition of all Tier X TDs (excluding HE(SH) shell of British TDs)

- Autoloader size combined with penetration and role means loading almost all APCR to do its job, which is extremely expensive even for Tier X

- Long and weakly armored side armor, will not bounce unless shells hit at an auto-bounce angle

- Rangerfinder can be easily penetrated by even Tier VIIs, and makes obvious target up close

- Weak engine compartment roof, extremely vulnerable against artillery fire or tall facehuggers

- Sluggish due to bad terrain resistance

- Limited gun arc, -6/+18 degrees vertical and Â±10 degrees horizontal

The Foch B is a slightly evolutionary upgrade of the Tier IX Foch with one big exception that makes all the difference. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  The autoloader magazine doubles in size from three shots to six. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  So while it is still a 120mm gun tank destroyer with obvious weakspots, staring it down is now a deadly proposition. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  

After undergoing a considerable revamp in patch 9. F64 AMX 50Fosh B 20, the Tier X Foch received a 120mm gun and more powerful engine. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  In compare to its previous 155mm mounting configuration, the new Foch B can now relocate and snipe with ease, making a much better supporter. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  While losing in penetration and alpha damage, the new 6 rounder still possesses formidable if not stronger one-clipping capability, provided one knows to exploit weak spots. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  With 2 more shells in drum than other 120mm sporting autoloaders, the Foch B can choose to expend a shot or two de-tracking first, thus pinning down the target for easier kill. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  In terms of protection, thicker sides and fighting compartment roof are now proof against large caliber autopens, but still prone to flanking or plunging fire. F64 AMX 50Fosh B

|History= 

See the [[AMX50 Foch]] history page for a complete history on the Foch itself. F64 AMX 50Fosh B 

The Foch B is essentially a "what-if" based on the AMX 50 Foch having a drum-based autoloader, similar to the AMX 50 heavy tanks. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  There are no known projects or blueprints that show such a design ever existed. F64 AMX 50Fosh B 

|HistAcc=
In-game description is false. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  The Foch was never designed to hold an autoloader even on blueprints. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  The historical version with the single-shot gun does not exist in World of Tanks. F64 AMX 50Fosh B 
* There was never any Foch project designated "Foch B". F64 AMX 50Fosh B 
* The tank is essentially a clone of the [[Tank:F37_AMX50_Foch|tier 9 AMX 50 Foch]] with almost identical specifications (gun, engine, radio) with the only difference at its extra sideskirt. F64 AMX 50Fosh B  Yet several stats were inconsistent to the original vehicle (such as the Foch B's suspension load limit is lower than original Foch, and extra ammunition capacity).
