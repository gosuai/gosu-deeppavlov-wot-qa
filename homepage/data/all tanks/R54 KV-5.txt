|This tank is known for its many weakspots as well as its impotent but fast-firing 107 ZiS-6M. R54 KV-5  It's surprisingly fast for a heavy tank, which tends to come in handy when you fail to pen your opponents. R54 KV-5 
Being extremely heavy and featuring a high top speed enables ramming of other tanks - adding to the damage output. R54 KV-5 

The KV-5 was buffed in 9. R54 KV-5 2. R54 KV-5  This buff was received badly by the community, and largely viewed as a pointless attempt at improving things that were fine while failing to address the core issues. R54 KV-5  This is in large part due to the KV-5's status as a 'veteran tank', that unlike the Type 59 has yet to see any ''competitive'' buffs. R54 KV-5 

There are many weak spots on this tank, which even after buffs to the armor model (9. R54 KV-5 2) means that you'll bounce close to nothing in an 'aimed brawl'. R54 KV-5  There are also a lot of flat surfaces of the turret. R54 KV-5  Granted that your ''extremely'' non-meta penetration values (both for AP and APCR) allows you to do anything but ding your opponent, the KV-5 can certainly be a force to be reckoned with. R54 KV-5  Just not against T9s, or even most T8 heavies. R54 KV-5  Or hulldown medium tanks, for that matter. R54 KV-5  Oh, and you probably won't spot any 'vision gaming' tank destroyers either. R54 KV-5 

In short, the KV-5 is an Swiss cheese roadblock that can work well if it doesn't face any armour. R54 KV-5  Does fit an aggressive playstyle rather well, but not worth your hard-earned money. R54 KV-5  
This tank was removed from the in game store with the introduction of version 0. R54 KV-5 7. R54 KV-5 5. R54 KV-5

|InTheGame_pros=

* Overall thick armor profile rewards angling and sidescraping
* Largest healthpool for a Tier 8 tank
* Good top speed and huge weight, good at ramming 
* Excellent DPM for a heavy tank, better than some mediums
* Preferential matchmaking

|InTheGame_cons=

* Poor penetration for a Tier 8 heavy tank
* Large and well-known weakspots
* While thick, the armor is mostly unsloped 
* Poor hull and turret traverse speed
* Massive target with poor camouflage values, easily spotted

Despite its enormous weight, the tank is able to reach a good speed for a heavy tank. R54 KV-5  This makes the KV-5 an excellent ramming tank, provided the enemy sits still at the bottom of a hill. R54 KV-5   The 107 mm gun ZIS-6M gun is effective against porrly armoured vehicles, although the penetration is extremely poor for its tier. R54 KV-5  The use of APCR ammunition is recommended, although even this struggles greatly. R54 KV-5  Its high rate of fire and fairly quick aim time can make the KV-5 a stark contrast to other KV-series tanks that players encounter. R54 KV-5  In addition, the shells are cheaper than those of its counterparts. R54 KV-5  

If possible, try to remain at medium to long distances from the enemy. R54 KV-5  The greater the distance, the more difficult for the enemy to penetrate your armor. R54 KV-5  The low turret traverse means you will have a hard time bringing your gun to bear at close ranges. R54 KV-5  However, if you get surprised by an enemy who's already close to you, don't stop. R54 KV-5  Ram. R54 KV-5  Stick close to your allies. R54 KV-5  Since the enemies would be aiming for your weaker allies, you could already possibly get the enemy before they can even get a shot on you. R54 KV-5  Cover your vulnerabilities, especially the two small turrets on the front of your hull, and also the commander's cupola. R54 KV-5  Versus tanks of the same tier or higher, the side armor is penetrable. R54 KV-5  Try to angle your tank towards the enemy. R54 KV-5  Stopping for a long time is fatal. R54 KV-5  You should move back and forth all the time to make it harder for the enemy to take aim. R54 KV-5 

When enemies do get within short range, the KV-5 is perfect for ramming due to its heavy weight and excellent maximum speed. R54 KV-5  For example, going downhill at full speed, the KV-5 can easily destroy tier 7 medium tanks, using a combination of "shoot, charge, ram, then a second (kill) shot. R54 KV-5 " Ramming heavy tanks may not be as beneficial, but is often part of any short-range attack. R54 KV-5  

Due to the weak armor penetration of the 107mm ZIS-6M, it is advised to know the weak spots of the enemy tanks you are facing (Lower plate and cupola are usually the most reliable and easy to hit weak spots). R54 KV-5  The high profile of the KV-5 allows you to shoot over low-profile tanks, such as the IS-3, while at the same time hiding your worst frontal weakspot. R54 KV-5  Use this to support allies by firing over them, or to shoot down on the roof armor of your opponents. R54 KV-5 

There are large weak spots on the hull and turret. R54 KV-5  So, limit your enemies' access to them, if you are in a city, [[sidescraping]] can work well. R54 KV-5  Sometimes, depending who is firing at you, driving around backwards actually can work. R54 KV-5  So, driving around backwards will not allow shots into your weakspots, but the controls are counter intuitive and only seasoned players should try this, as it is very hard to do well. R54 KV-5  Do be careful, though, as the upper half of the rear is 90mm flat plate, and is easily penetrated. R54 KV-5

|History=
Work was begun on the KV-5 tank ("Object 225") in June 1941. R54 KV-5  The talented designer N. R54 KV-5  Tseits, one of the oldest workers of SKB-2, was named the senior engineer for this vehicle. R54 KV-5  Also in his group were K. R54 KV-5  Kuzmin (hull), L. R54 KV-5  Sychev (turret and gun mount), and N. R54 KV-5  Fedorchuk (running gear components). R54 KV-5  The experience gained in the development of the KV-4 design was weighed during the design of the KV-5. R54 KV-5  The result was a powerful tank of relatively unusual appearance. R54 KV-5  The hull of the KV-5 had a height of 0. R54 KV-5 92 metres. R54 KV-5  Therefore the driver-mechanic and radio operator-machine gunner received special cupolas that permitted them an adequate sector of view. R54 KV-5  The rhomboid-shaped turret was of relatively large size. R54 KV-5  Housed in it were the tank commander, who had a commander's cupola, gunner, and loader. R54 KV-5  The solid diameter of the ring was 1840 mm and the large internal space of the turret afforded all members of the crew normal working conditions. R54 KV-5  The tank was heavily armored-150-180 mm. R54 KV-5 

With the beginning of the war, a whole series of collectives entered the project. R54 KV-5  Thus, the notion of a forged turret was abandoned and replaced by a welded turret design. R54 KV-5  In view of the absence of a 1200 h. R54 KV-5 p. R54 KV-5  diesel engine (it was still in development), the KV-5 was redesigned for the installation of two parallel-mounted conventional V-12 engines. R54 KV-5 

By August 1941 the KV-5 design was practically fully completed, and the production of a number of the tank's components and aggregates was begun. R54 KV-5  But because of the difficult situation at the front around Leningrad, all experimental work at the Kirov Plant was halted and all efforts were dedicated to increasing the output of production KV tanks. R54 KV-5  The latest date found in the preserved drawings of the KV-5 is 15 August 1941, when the battle was being fought around Luga and Krasnogvardeysk. R54 KV-5 
The project was eventually canceled in favour of the more advanced Russian heavy tank designs. R54 KV-5  No prototype was ever constructed due to the Leningrad Blockade. R54 KV-5
