|InTheGame_pros= 
*Reasonably mobile with good hull traverse and power to weight ratio

*Decent radio range

*Decent sloped glacis armor, can bounce some autocannons if properly angled

|InTheGame_cons=

* View range is severely lacking, 270 meters is just not enough

* '''Very bad''' gun. G117 Toldi III  Low accuracy and bad dispersion penalty; everything else is on the lower side. G117 Toldi III  

* Has the lowest DPM in the game, 3rd lowest if you equip the strv fm/21 and the 4TP, it's closest competitors
with stock guns

* In addition, reload time is ridiculously long at 4 seconds, even a few Tier 2 vehicles might outtrade you

* Recommended not to snipe due to BAD dispersion and shell velocity 

|InTheGame_performance= 
* Soft armor leads to frequent module damage 

* Outclassed in almost every aspect by the [[Pz. G117 Toldi III Kpfw. G117 Toldi III  T 15]], [[Strv m/40L]] and the [[M3 Stuart|Stu]][[Stuart I-IV|arts]], totally depriving its gameplay or credit farming/crew training values. G117 Toldi III  Avoid purchasing it unless solely for collection purpose. G117 Toldi III
