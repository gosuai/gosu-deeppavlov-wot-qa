|This was the first German heavy tank in WWII and proved itself to be extremely formidable against the Allied forces, composed primarily of [[M4 Sherman]]s and [[T-34]]s. G04 PzVI Tiger I  In the game you'll face much higher tier opponents. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This tank was designed as a medium to long range sniper. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Keep that in mind and make use of its great rate of fire and renowned German-engineered accuracy. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Spot your enemy, avoid close combat, and keep your gun at work by firing the moment you reload. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Snipe the enemy and support your team. G04 PzVI Tiger I  

|InTheGame_pros=
* Top 88mm gun is excellent, with good DPM, accuracy and penetration
* Decent gun depression
* Above-average frontal turret armour. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Shooting the left, right, upper, and lower edges of the mantlet requires ~200mm penetration thanks to underlying turret armour. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The central portion is only 135-150mm thick, but is also fairly small and the gun mount is conically angled to 250+mm. G04 PzVI Tiger I 
* Large hitpoint pool, comparable to many Tier 8 heavy tanks
* Fairly good at sidescraping thanks to the flat side armor and large tracks
* High top speed thanks to the low rolling resistance of large-diameter roadwheels. G04 PzVI Tiger I 
* Excellent flotation thanks to a combination of wide tracks and a large number of roadwheel contact points (16 axles in total). G04 PzVI Tiger I 
* High turn rate. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Yes, the power/weight ratio may be below average, but the flotation more than makes up for it. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

|InTheGame_cons=
* Long aimtime on the top 88mm gun
* Though the hull armour is thick, and resists  HE quite well, it is also flat and vulnerable to AP shells even from Tier 5 guns. G04 PzVI Tiger I 
* Exposed turret ring. G04 PzVI Tiger I 
* Hull sponsons make sidescraping awkward, though the sponsons can be hard to hit from a distance. G04 PzVI Tiger I 
* Frequent transmission/engine and ammo rack damage
* Slow turret traverse, reacts sluggishly when ambushed
* Unsuited for face to face brawling, too slow and easily prone to module damage


|InTheGame_performance=
Many German tanks are great snipers, and the Tiger is no exception. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Its top gun, the 8. G04 PzVI Tiger I 8 cm KwK 43 L/71, is extremely accurate (0. G04 PzVI Tiger I 34), inflicts good damage, has a phenomenal rate of fire and has excellent penetration, enough to go through any Tier 9's weak spots. G04 PzVI Tiger I  If you are at the bottom of the list, let your allies spot the enemies for you to snipe. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Stay at a distance, using bushes if possible, and with your superior accuracy and armor penetration you'll soon whittle them down. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, it's still best to equip Optics (or even Binocs since this tank often stays stationary in thick bushes, like a sniper would) in case you don't have allies to spot for you, as the base view range is quite good for its tier. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This gun is formidable even in the tier 8 arena, and will have no problem penetrating most tier 8 heavies from the front. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The armour though does not hold up to its historical value because the direct competitors of this tank were designed to counter the tiger (IS, T29, etc. G04 PzVI Tiger I ). G04 PzVI Tiger I  If you find yourself at the front in close proximity to enemy heavies that are the same or higher tier than you you have done something wrong. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The armour of this tank just will not save you. G04 PzVI Tiger I  While you can side scrape you are completely vulnerable when you take a shot because you have to expose the flat front of the turret to bring the gun to bear; even when side scraping only the hull will bounce. G04 PzVI Tiger I  If enemy tanks like a hulldown t29 catch you at medium range you are screwed; you will be spotted when you fire and the enemy will go through your armour like a hot knife through butter. G04 PzVI Tiger I  While you might be able to snipe weak spots they just have to be able to hit you to do damage and at medium to close range that is not hard. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The armour of this tank really is bad. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The IS for example has 20mm more armour at the front for bother the hull and turret AND the IS has sloped/rounded armour. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Artillery eats tigers up for breakfast. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Tigers are big, have thin unsloped armour, and large health pools to farm damage from. G04 PzVI Tiger I 
Although the Tiger has some of the best and most reliable DPM values for a Tier VII tank, the armor is weak and boxy, even when angled, a handful of tanks, such as the T29, can penetrate the Tiger with relative ease. G04 PzVI Tiger I  New players will be in for quite a surprise when even some tier V tanks damage them. G04 PzVI Tiger I   While it's good to be aggressive in a game, a destroyed tank is of no use to anybody and this is especially true for the Tiger, for as long as it's kept alive, it will deal incredible amounts of damage. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The good news is that the Tiger has a tough turret frontally for when you can get hull-down, and the side armor is decent for sidescraping. G04 PzVI Tiger I   Even if it is at the top of the tier, caution is still advised for tanks such as the KV-1 have enough penetration or have HE guns to pose a sufficient threat against your thin, boxy armor. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, don't be afraid to take a few shots later on in the game; your Hit Point is best in tier and will enable to you to switch positions as well as give you an opportunity to play your DPM against the enemy when possible. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

In short - this tank is a complete gem to players who like a cautious, supportive play style, and should be played as such. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, many players run through this tank to get to the [[Tiger II]] without proper knowledge and experience, and these players tend to give this tank a bad reputation. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Make no mistake, the Tiger (H) is a formidable tank once the player works out the unique style of the tank. G04 PzVI Tiger I  

|InTheGame_research=
* The 8. G04 PzVI Tiger I 8 cm KwK 36 L/56 cannon and the radios carry over from VK 36. G04 PzVI Tiger I 01 (H). G04 PzVI Tiger I  You can equip the 8,8 cm L/56 immediately for better DPM or stick with the 7,5 cm L/70 for its higher penetration. G04 PzVI Tiger I  But you will have a hard time hitting anything. G04 PzVI Tiger I 
* Research the upgraded suspension for more weight capacity and traverse speed. G04 PzVI Tiger I  
* Next research the "Pz. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kpfw. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Tiger Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I  E" turret and then the 8,8cm KwK 43 L/71 cannon. G04 PzVI Tiger I  You might want to hold off on equipping the second turret until you have the cannon researched, since the turret traverse drops by quite a bit. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The cannon is what makes it worth it. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It is necessary to excel with this tank. G04 PzVI Tiger I 
* Research the engine "Maybach HL 230 TRM P45" for a noticeable boost in horsepower. G04 PzVI Tiger I  There will be a striking boost in acceleration. G04 PzVI Tiger I

<h2>The Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I E (Tiger I)</h2>

'''''German Doctrine - defining the basis for the heavy tank concept'''''. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_0. G04 PzVI Tiger I png|200px|center]]

German doctrine before World War II didn't clearly specify the parameters used to define a light, medium, or heavy tank. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This lack of an exact definition of the role of each tank-type was a result of the inherent qualities of the tank as a weapons system operating in a combined arms force, and as such, its potential were not fully understood at the time. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The same conceptual lack of a clear definition of the three generic tank-types also existed in the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union. G04 PzVI Tiger I  What existed was a somewhat loose classification based on the weight of the tank and the doctrinal missions of each type. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

In face of that, what was generally accepted was that the light tank was to be employed in reconnaissance missions, which demanded great mobility but didn't require much armor protection or great lethality. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The medium tank was to be used in exploitation or pursuit missions, requiring a different mix of mobility, armor protection, and firepower. G04 PzVI Tiger I  To fulfill these requirements, medium tanks had to be fast and have a greater level of mechanical reliability, since those tanks needed to be able of conducting fast maneuvers necessary to exploitation or pursuit missions. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Under this classification, heavy tanks were to act as support for the infantry and artillery, but the main purpose of the heavy tank was to penetrate the enemy's defenses, thus allowing the medium tanks to exploit the breakthrough. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, that classification also implied the assumption that the light and medium tanks could, to an extent, perform each other's missions. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This was not possible for heavy tanks, as they wouldn't have the same degree of speed and the operational range of the other two types because of the greater weight, consequence(s) of the heavier weapons, and high degree of armor protection required for these tanks. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

In 1937, Guderian described the operational principles and tactics that would shape German thinking on how to employ armored formations in a future war. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The mission of the heavy tank within this concept was to effect a breakthrough, and its first objective was to engage and destroy the enemy's anti-tank guns in the defensive line. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The next objective of the heavy tanks was to destroy the enemy artillery, but Guderian correctly anticipated that the penetration of the defensive lines would force the enemy to throw his armor reserves in a counter-attack. G04 PzVI Tiger I  About the importance of defeating this counter-attack, Guderian emphasized that the greatest enemy of the tank is another tank, and that because of that, the armored forces had to be capable of defeating this counterattack, or the breakthrough would fail. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The German doctrine of that time focused mainly on the offensive. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Naturally, when the tide turned against Germany, the doctrinal recommendation was that the armor formations would be kept back, and ready to counter-attack any breakthrough of the German defense lines. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Consequently, the doctrinal mission of the Tiger was first and foremost, whether in the offense or in the defense, to kill the enemy's tanks. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Understanding this way of thinking is fundamental to comprehend why the Tiger was developed and employed the way it was. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Tiger I is the common name of a German heavy tank developed in 1942 and used in World War II. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The final official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I E, often shortened to Tiger. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It was an answer to the unexpectedly impressive Soviet armour encountered in the initial months of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, particularly the T-34 and the KV-1. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Tiger I gave the Wehrmacht its first tank mounting the 88 mm gun in its first armoured fighting vehicle-dedicated version: the KwK 36. G04 PzVI Tiger I  During the course of the war, the Tiger I saw combat on all German battlefronts. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It was usually deployed in independent tank battalions, which proved to be quite formidable. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

While the Tiger I was feared by many of its opponents, it was over-engineered, using expensive materials and labour intensive production methods. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Only 1,347 were built between August 1942 and August 1944. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Tiger was prone to certain types of track failures and immobilizations, and limited in range by its high fuel consumption. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It was expensive to maintain, but generally mechanically reliable. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It was also difficult to transport, and vulnerable to immobilization when mud, ice and snow froze between its overlapping and interleaved road wheels in winter weather conditions, often jamming them solid. G04 PzVI Tiger I  In 1944, production was phased out in favour of the Tiger II. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The tank was given its nickname "Tiger" by Ferdinand Porsche, and the Roman numeral was added after the later Tiger II entered production. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The initial official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausführung H (‘Panzer VI version H’, abbreviated PzKpfw VI Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I  H), with ordnance inventory designation SdKfz 182, but the tank was redesignated as PzKpfw VI Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I  E in March 1943, with ordnance inventory designation SdKfz 181. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Today, only a handful of Tigers survive in museums and exhibitions worldwide. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Bovington Tank Museum's Tiger 131 is currently the only one restored to running order. G04 PzVI Tiger I

'''''Development of the Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I E'''''

Despite the decision to mass produce the Pz. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kpfw. G04 PzVI Tiger I III and IV, and the far certainty (at the time) that these two models would be adequate for the expected battles of the future, the German general staff also called for an even heavier tank in 1937. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This was to be of 29. G04 PzVI Tiger I 53 tons (30,000 kg) or more and was to be a heavy "breakthrough" tank to lead the armored assaults. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The design lapsed until 1941, by when it was realized that the Pz. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kpfw. G04 PzVI Tiger I III and IV had been less successful than had been expected against the heavily-armored French and British tanks in 1940. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This view was fully endorsed when the Soviet T-34s and KV-1s were met later in 1941, and resulted in a specification for a heavy tank capable of mounting the highly successful 88 mm high-velocity gun in a turret with full traverse and carrying sufficient armor to defeat all present and future anti-tank weapons. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Two firms submitted prototypes, using some of the developments from the 1937 ideas. G04 PzVI Tiger I  These were Porsche and Henschel. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The turret was common to both and came from Krupp. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

It is interesting to add, at this point, that Hitler had demonstrated great interest in the Rheinmetall 88mm Flak 41 as the main gun of the Tiger I. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This was an indigestable proposition for Krupp, which designed and built the Tiger I turret, to have to mount, in their turret, a gun developed by their arch-rival. G04 PzVI Tiger I  In the end, events unfolded in such a way that the main gun of the Tiger I would be the 88mm KwK 36 L/56, as Porsche never asked Krupp for a turret with 200 cm of diameter (necessary to mount the 88mm Flak 41 on it), but ordered the production of 6 turrets with a 190 cm diameter, to mount the 88mm KwK 36 L/56. G04 PzVI Tiger I  After the turrets production started, it was impossible to mount the 88mm Flak 41 on the Tiger I turrets. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The official WaPrüf 6 designation to the Porsche prototype from 5 March 1942 was PzKpfw VI (VK 45. G04 PzVI Tiger I 01 P) (Ausfürung P). G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Inspekteur der Panzertruppen (In6) designation, specified for use in training, maintenance manuals, and in organization tables, was Panzerkampfwagen VI P (88 mm) (SdKfz 181) Ausfürung P. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Suggested names were 'Tiger (P)', 'Tiger P1' or 'Porsche Tiger'. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Henschel prototype received the designation VK 45. G04 PzVI Tiger I 01 (H). G04 PzVI Tiger I  This Henschel model came into being as a rush job, quickly assembled from a mixture of components available from previous heavy panzer designs. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Henschel was not originally involved in the 45 metric ton heavy-tanks project, as they had been tasked with the development of a 36 metric ton medium tank with 80 mm front armor, the designation of which was Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausfürung B (VK 36. G04 PzVI Tiger I 01). G04 PzVI Tiger I  To meet the demand that the production program was to start in 1942, the VK 45. G04 PzVI Tiger I 01(H) was quickly created by redesigning the VK 36. G04 PzVI Tiger I 01. G04 PzVI Tiger I  A new feature was the Vorpanzer (frontal shield), which could be lowered to protect the track and drive sprockets. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, this feature was quickly dropped, having only been fitted on this Versuchsserie Tiger Nr. G04 PzVI Tiger I  'V1'. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_2. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

After tests conducted on 20 April 1942, the Henschel prototype was chosen for series production. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The decision was based on a maneuverability test, and on the fact that the Henschel prototype was more conventional: cheaper and easier to produce than the extravagant Porsche design. G04 PzVI Tiger I  At the time of its introduction, and for some time afterwards, the Tiger was the most powerful tank in the world. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The 88 mm gun, which had 92 rounds of ammunition, was enormously formidable, and the armor ensured that any frontal shot could not penetrate. G04 PzVI Tiger I  So effective was it that the Allies had to develop special tactics to deal with it. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Production began slowly in August 1942. G04 PzVI Tiger I

== Official Designation ==

Thomas L. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Jentz, in "Germany's Tiger Tanks: Vol. G04 PzVI Tiger I 1 - D. G04 PzVI Tiger I W. G04 PzVI Tiger I  to Tiger I" (Schiffer, 2000), presents a list of official names given to the Tiger I, ordered by date, from 1941 to 1944:

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_4. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

The last denomination is the one that is the official name for the Tiger I. G04 PzVI Tiger I  So, it is either '''Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I E (Sd. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kfz. G04 PzVI Tiger I 181)''', - Sd. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kfz. G04 PzVI Tiger I  is the abbreviation for Sonderkraftfahrzeug (Special Purpose Vehicle, or Special Ordnance Vehicle, a classification used, beside other vehicles, for the Panzers), or '''Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I E''', and thats the official designation until the end of the war. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Walter J. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Spielberger, in "Tigers I and II and their Variants" (Schiffer, 2007), cites a Führer's order, dated February 27, 1944, which abolished the designation "Panzerkampfwagen VI" and ratified the name '''Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I E''' as the official designation. G04 PzVI Tiger I 


== Armor Protection ==

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_5. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

The hull of the Tiger was a comparatively simple welded unit with a one-piece superstructure welded on top. G04 PzVI Tiger I  At the front it was 100 mm, around the sides 80 mm, and 26 mm on the top. G04 PzVI Tiger I  To assist production, all shapes were kept simple. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The turret was also simple, and the sides were almost upright. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It remains a curious fact why Henschel's engineers came up with what was essentially a square box for the Tiger's hull. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The only steeply-sloping element on the Tiger was the short glacis plate, forward of the hull upper front plate with its ball-mounted machine gun and driver's vision slots, which was set at 81 degrees to the vertical. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, the vertical plating was massive enough to withstand virtually everything. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The mantlet was very heavy, with 120 mm of armor, and carried the long and heavy gun. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Below, the armor tables for the Tiger I:

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_6. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

According to Jentz (JENTZ, Thomas L. G04 PzVI Tiger I ; Germany's TIGER Tanks - Tiger I and II: Combat Tactics; op. G04 PzVI Tiger I  cit. G04 PzVI Tiger I ), "The Tiger's armor was invulnerable to attack from most tank guns firing normal armor-piercing shells or shot at ranges over 800 meters, including the American 75 mm and the Russian 76 mm. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It is obvious that the 17-pdr. G04 PzVI Tiger I , firing normal APCBC rounds, could defeat the frontal armor of the Tiger I at most combat ranges in tank vs. G04 PzVI Tiger I  tank actions in Europe. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, by 23 June 1944, only 109 Shermans with 17-pdrs. G04 PzVI Tiger I  had landed in France, along with six replacements. G04 PzVI Tiger I  By the end of the war, on 5 May 1945, the British 21st Army Group possessed 1,235 Sherman tanks with 17-pdrs. G04 PzVI Tiger I , while the remaining 1,915 Sherman tanks were all equipped with the 75 mm M3 gun". G04 PzVI Tiger I  Below, three more tables from the same source (JENTZ, Thomas L. G04 PzVI Tiger I ; Germany's TIGER Tanks - Tiger I and II: Combat Tactics; op. G04 PzVI Tiger I  cit. G04 PzVI Tiger I ), that show clearly the tactical superiority the Tiger I had over its contemporary adversaries:

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_7. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

With the exception of British guns, the data on the penetration tables above were extracted from a "Wa Prüf 1" report dated 5th October 1944, which relate the relative ability of the major opponents to penetrate the Tiger and vice versa. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Data on British gun capabilities were extracted from British penetration test reports. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The penetration ranges in the tables were determined for conditions in which the tanks stood at a side angle of 30 degrees of the incoming round. G04 PzVI Tiger I  These tables should be used only for comparison of the relative vulnerability of the opponent's tanks. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The data are not to be misconstructed as the absolute ranges at which the armor could be penetrated. G04 PzVI Tiger I  There was a fairly large variance in both the protection offered by the same thickness of different armor plates and thickness penetrated by the same type of armor-piercing projectiles. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Also, the ranges shown in tables above "are all approximations based on calculations using estimates of the capabilities of American and Russian guns and penetration numbers derived from German guns firing against German armor plate. G04 PzVI Tiger I "

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_8. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

The armor of the Tiger I was not well sloped, but it was thick. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Here is where many fail to understand that, in terms of World War II tank warfare, thickness was a quality in itself, since armor resistance is mainly determined by the ratio between armor thickness and projectile diameter (T/d). G04 PzVI Tiger I  The T/d relationship regarding armor penetration demonstrates that the more the thickness of the armor plate overmatches the diameter of any incoming armor piercing round, the harder it is for the projectile to achieve a penetration. G04 PzVI Tiger I  On the other side, the greater the diameter of the incoming projectile relative to the thickness of the armor plate which it strikes, the greater the probability of penetration. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This explains why the side armor of the Tiger I, being 80 mm thick, was so difficult to be penetrated at combat ranges by most Allied anti-tank and tank guns, whose calibers were overmatched by the thickness of the Tiger I armor. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The rolled homogeneous nickel-steel plate and electro-welded interlocking-plate construction armor had a Brinell hardness index of around 255-280 (the best homogeneous-armor hardness level for the corresponding thickness level of the Tiger's armor, by WW II standards), and rigorous quality control procedures ensured that it stayed that way. G04 PzVI Tiger I  About this issue, and according to Thomas L. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Jentz, "there is no proof that substandard german armor plate was used during the last years of the war. G04 PzVI Tiger I  All original documents confirm compliance with standard specifications throughout the war" (JENTZ, Thomas L. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Germany's TIGER Tanks, VK45. G04 PzVI Tiger I 02 to Tiger II: Design, Production & Modifications). G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Moreover, in the same reference book, Jentz presents the data from a British testing of the Tiger's armor protection by firing different guns against it. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The tests were realized in a place beside the the main road from Beja to Sidi N'sir in Tunisia, on May 19, 1943. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The reports from these tests stated that the resistance of the Tiger's armor was "considerably higher than that of the British machineable quality armor. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The side armor, with a thickness of 82 mm (nominal thickness was 80 mm) had a resistance equivalent of 92 mm of British armor" (Jentz, op cit, page 15). G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, a little further, when addressing directly the issue of the Tiger's armor quality, the report states that "The armor plates (with exception of the hull roof plates) did not show any marked tendency to brittleness, and their behavior generally was not unlike British mechineable plates. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The following table gives a list of Poldi hardness, corrected to Brinell figures, taken at the surface of the armor". G04 PzVI Tiger I 

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_9. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

The Tiger, as a result of its intrinsic doctrinal mission, that is, to effect a breakthrough and to support medium tanks during the breakthrough by destroying enemy tanks, was (production-wise) a very expensive and resource-consuming tank. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The nominal cost of a Tiger was 250,800 Reichsmarks. G04 PzVI Tiger I  In contrast, a PzKpfw III Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I  M cost RM 103,163, a PzKpfw IV Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I  G RM 115,962, and a PzKpfw V Panther RM 117,100: all these figures are exclusive of weapons and radios. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, the final cost of the Tiger's production was even higher: around 300,000 Reichsmarks. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Christopher W. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Wilbeck, in "Sledgehammers: Strengths and Flaws of Tiger Heavy Tank Battalions in World War II", citing the Tigerfibel (the Tiger's manual), states that the final cost of the Tiger's production was much higher - 800,000 Reichsmarks, and 300,000 man-hours were required to produce one single Tiger. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Tigerfibel, in view of making those numbers more personal to the Tiger crewmen, stated that it was required one week of hard work from 6,000 people to produce one Tiger. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It also stated that the 800,000 Reichsmarks figure was equivalent to the weekly wages for 30,000 people. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_10. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

As an added benefit, due to its resilience, when a Tiger was damaged and was subsequently destroyed by its crew, the crew frequently managed to escape capture and return to their unit, and this helped to create experienced crews. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This benefit oviously came at a cost in other aspects, however. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Another fact that helped the Tigers a lot was the "shatter gap" effect which affected allied ammunition, a most unusual situation where rounds with too-high an impact velocity would sometimes fail, even though their penetration capability was (theoretically) more than adequate. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This phenomenon plagued the British 2 pounder in the desert, and would have decreased the effectiveness of U. G04 PzVI Tiger I S. G04 PzVI Tiger I  76mm and 3" guns against Tigers, Panthers, and other vehicles with armor thickness above 70 mm. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It should be noted that the problems with the 76 mm and 3" guns did not necessarily involve the weapons themselves: the noses of US armor-piercing ammunition of the time turned out to be excessively soft. G04 PzVI Tiger I  When these projectiles impacted armor which matched or exceeded the projectile diameter at a certain spread of velocities, the projectile would shatter and fail. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Penetrations would occur below this velocity range, since the shell would not shatter, and strikes above this range would propel the shell through the armor whether it shattered or not. G04 PzVI Tiger I  When striking a Tiger I driver's plate, for example, this "shatter gap" for a 76mm APCBC M62 shell would cause failures between 50 meters and 900 meters. G04 PzVI Tiger I  These ammunition deficiencies proved that Ordnance tests claiming the 76 mm gun could penetrate a Tiger I's upper front hull to 2,000 yards (1,800 meters) were sadly incorrect. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

As a general rule, BHN (Brinell Hardness Index) effects shot shatter, and obliquity effects are related to the ratio between shot diameter and plate thickness. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The relationship is complex, but a larger projectile hitting relatively thinner plate will usually have the advantage. G04 PzVI Tiger I  There is an optimum BHN level for every shot vs plate confrontation, usually in the 260-300 BHN range for World War Two situations. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Below that, the armor is too soft and resists poorly, above that, the armor is too hard and therefore too brittle. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The 13. G04 PzVI Tiger I (Tiger) Kompanie, of Panzer Regiment Großdeutschland, reported on the armor protection of the Tiger: "During a scouting patrol, two Tigers encountered about 20 Russian tanks on their front, while additional Russian tanks attacked from behind. G04 PzVI Tiger I  A battle developed in which the armor and weapons of the Tiger were extraordinarily successful. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Both Tigers were hit (mainly by 76. G04 PzVI Tiger I 2 mm armor-piercing shells) 10 or more times at ranges from 500 to 1,000 meters. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The armor held up all around. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Not a single round penetrated through the armor. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Also, hits in the running gear, in which the suspension arms were torn away, did not immobilize the Tiger. G04 PzVI Tiger I  While 76. G04 PzVI Tiger I 2 mm anti-tank shells continuously struck outside the armor, on the inside undisturbed, the commander, gunner, and loader selected targets, aimed, and fired. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The end result was 10 enemy tanks knocked out by two Tigers within 15 minutes"

All this considered, and analyzing the tables above, it stands clear that "based on opposing ranges, without considering other factors, the Tiger I had only been outclassed by the Russian Josef Stalin heavy tank with the 122 mm gun" (Again, JENTZ, Thomas L. G04 PzVI Tiger I ; Germany's TIGER Tanks - Tiger I and II: Combat Tactics; op. G04 PzVI Tiger I  cit. G04 PzVI Tiger I ). G04 PzVI Tiger I 

It was said that it took at least five American M4 Sherman medium tanks to knock out a cornered Tiger. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Whether it is fact or hearsay was not confirmed. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, its interesting to note that according to the kill/losses achived by the Tiger battalions, the overall ratio was 5. G04 PzVI Tiger I 74 to 1 (WILBECK, Christopher W. G04 PzVI Tiger I , op cit). G04 PzVI Tiger I 

When speaking about opposing ranges, it becomes necessary to take a look at another essential Tiger I feature: the KwK 36 L/56 8. G04 PzVI Tiger I 8 cm gun. G04 PzVI Tiger I 


== Firepower ==

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_12. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

The 8. G04 PzVI Tiger I 8 cm KwK 36 L/56 was an adaptation of the famous 8. G04 PzVI Tiger I 8 cm Flak 36, which was a development of the Flugzeugabwehrkanone Model 18 (Flak 18). G04 PzVI Tiger I  In informal German use, this gun was universally known as the Acht-acht, a contraction of Acht-komma-acht Zentimeter (8. G04 PzVI Tiger I 8 cm = 88 mm), and was first used in combat by the Condor Legion, in Spain, where it earned the reputation of being an excellent anti-aircraft gun as well as a tank killer. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This capacity would be confirmed during the French campaign in 1940, and most spectacularly in the hands of Rommel's Afrika Korps in North Africa. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Flak 36 was essentially a Flak 18 mounted in three sections, making it possible to change the part of the barrel that suffered the most attrition from the high-velocity rounds. G04 PzVI Tiger I  By the time the Wehrmacht was heavily committed in Russia, it proved to be the only gun in the German inventory able to destroy the new T-34 and KV-2 Russian tanks at longer ranges. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_13. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

In 1938, the 8. G04 PzVI Tiger I 8 cm Flak 18 was considered for firing against ground targets, specifically armored/concrete pillboxes and enclosures, and the armor piercing ammunition that would be in service from this time onwards consisted of the 8. G04 PzVI Tiger I 8 cm Panzergranate weighing around 9. G04 PzVI Tiger I 5 kg with armor piercing cap and ballistic cap with a high explosive filler of 160 grams. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Muzzle velocity is listed as 810 m/s from the L/56 barrel of the Flak 18 and Flak 36/37. G04 PzVI Tiger I  During early 1942, the penetration ability was improved with the introduction of the Pzgr. G04 PzVI Tiger I 39 of 10. G04 PzVI Tiger I 2 kg weight with a reduced HE filler of 59 grams. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Muzzle velocity was 800 m/s. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The early Blitzkrieg up to early 1942 saw the use of the large capacity Pzgr. G04 PzVI Tiger I  with penetration at less than 100 mm at 30 degrees. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The 88 mm Flak APCBC round, which fought the KV and T34 tanks during 1941 and early 1942, was less effective than the round fired by the Tiger's 88 mm KwK 36 L/56. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Even the later 88 mm Flak round, with a large capacity high explosive filler (and 9. G04 PzVI Tiger I 54 kg weight), penetrated from 8% to 23% less than the 88 mm KwK 36 L/56 APCBC round. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_14. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

In May 1941, the German general staff demanded a new Kampfwagen Kanone (Tank Gun) specification for the Tiger; it had to be capable of penetrating 140 mm thick armor at a range of 1,000 meters, without specifying that the caliber had to be 88mm. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This specification was a direct consequence of Hitler's directive dated 26 May 1941, which stated that if the same penetration capability could be achieved by a gun of smaller caliber than 88mm, then preference should be given to the smaller caliber gun, based on the increased ammunition load and the lower turret weight. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, the same directive stated that the chosen caliber must be adequate to engaging tanks, ground targets, and bunkers. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This resulted in Rheinmetall receiving a contract in mid-July 1941, to design a turret with a gun that fulfilled those requirements. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The first gun designed by Rheinmetall, the 75mm KwK L/60, barely met the requirements: being able to achieve a penetration of 100mm of armor inclined at 30 degrees at a range of 1400 meters. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

In face of that, Rheinmetall, in order to to ensure that the penetration specificaton was met, developed a longer gun, the 75mm KwK 42 L/70, to be fitted in a new turret designed around this new gun. G04 PzVI Tiger I  By July 1 1942, long range plans under Hitler Panzerprogramm II established that the first 100 production series tanks would mount the 88mm KwK 36 L/56 in the Krupp turret. G04 PzVI Tiger I  From the 101st tank on in February 1943, production should be shifted to the Rheinmetall turret with the 75mm KwK 42 L/70. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This was to be the famous gun that would be mounted on the PzKpfw. G04 PzVI Tiger I  V Panther. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

However, at a Panzerkomission meeting on 14 July 1942, the subject of Tiger armament was discussed again, and it was verified that the ability to penetrate 100mm of armor, under the required conditions, was also achieved by the 88mm KwK 36 L/56, therefore conversion to the 75mm KwK 42 L/70 was no longer necessary, and conversion to the 88mm KwK L/71 would ocurr at the end of the same year. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This decision resulted in the entire production run of Tigers being outfitted with turrets mounting the 88mm KwK 36 L/56. G04 PzVI Tiger I  As a matter of fact, this increase in the penetration abilities of the 88mm KwK 36 L/56 resulted exclusively from changes to the design of the armor piercing (APCBC) ammunition. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Greater armor penetration was achieved by decreasing the size of the explosive filler cavity inside the shell, which also increased the weight to 10. G04 PzVI Tiger I 2 kilograms (JENTZ, Thomas L. G04 PzVI Tiger I ; Germany's TIGER Tanks - Tiger I and II: Combat Tactics; op. G04 PzVI Tiger I  cit. G04 PzVI Tiger I ). G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Behind the decision to retain the the 88 mm KwK 36 L/56 as the main gun of the Tiger I instead of the Rheinmetall 75 mm KwK 42 L/70, was the fact that at that time, armor penetration was mainly a function of thickness to diameter (T/d) ratio. G04 PzVI Tiger I  During World War II, the Armor Piercing (AP) round relied on its own weight (and a 88 mm KwK 36 L/56 gun APCBC shell weighed 10. G04 PzVI Tiger I 2 kilograms, as opposed by an 75 mm KwK 42 L/70 gun APCBC shell, which weighed 6. G04 PzVI Tiger I 8 kilograms) to penetrate the enemy's armor. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Theoretically, the higher the muzzle velocity, the more penetration any kind of AP round would have, all other variables remaining constant. G04 PzVI Tiger I  In real World War Two tank combat, however, other important variables intervened, such as the thickness to diameter (T/d) coefficient, which means that the bigger the diameter of any given round relative to the thickness of the armor it is going to strike, the better the probability of achieving a penetration. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Furthermore, if the diameter of the armor piercing round overmatches the thickness of the armor plate, the protection given by the inclination of the armor plate diminishes proportionally to the increase in the overmatch of the armor piercing round diameter or, in other words, to the increase in this T/d overmatch. G04 PzVI Tiger I  So, when a Tiger hit a T-34, the 88 mm diameter of the Tiger's round overmatched the 45 mm glacis plate of the T-34 by so much that it made no difference that the Russian tank's glacis was inclined at an angle of 60 degrees from vertical. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

For those facts, the 88mm KwK 36 L/56 was a better choice for a breakthrough tank such as the Tiger, according to German doctrine, as stated in the Manual for Combat and Combat Employment of Smaller Units: "The heavy tank forms the core of the spearhead and their main objective is the enemy tanks and antitank guns that can be eliminated only by using the greater range and larger caliber gun of those tanks. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The mission of the first wave is to penetrate into the enemy lines as deeply as possible while the second wave enlarges the penetration, never losing sight of the first wave in order to provide fire protection to that wave" (Source: WILBECK, Christopher W. G04 PzVI Tiger I , Sledgehammers: Strengths and Flaws of Tiger Heavy Tank Battalions in World War II). G04 PzVI Tiger I 

And more: "Armor obliquity-effects decrease as the shot diameter overmatches plate thickness, in part because there is a smaller cylindrical surface area of the displaced slug of armor which can cling to the surrounding plate. G04 PzVI Tiger I  If the volume which the shot displaces has lots of area to cling to on the parent plate, it resists penetration better than if that same volume is spread out into a disc with a relatively small area where it joins the undisturbed armor. G04 PzVI Tiger I  A plate greatly-overmatching shot involves the projectile digging its own tunnel, as it were, through the thick interior of the plate. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It was found experimentally that the regions in the center of the plate produced the bulk of the resistance to penetration, while the outer regions, near front and rear surfaces, presented minimal resistance because they are unsupported. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Thus, an overmatched plate will be forced to rely on tensile stresses within the displaced disc, and will tend to break out in front of the attacking projectile, regardless of whether the edges cling to the parent material or not. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Plate-obliquity works in defeating projectiles partly because it turns and deflects the projectile before it begins digging in. G04 PzVI Tiger I  If there is insufficient material where the side of the nose contacts the plate, stresses will travel all the way through the plate and break out the unsupported back surface. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The plate will fail instantaneously, rather than gradually". G04 PzVI Tiger I 

"You can angle the armor any way you want, and beyond a certain point of a shot overmatching the plate, the obliquity will cease to be relevant. G04 PzVI Tiger I  In fact, at certain conditions of shots overmatching the plate, the cosine rule is broken and the plate resists less-well than the simple cosine relationship would predict (LOS thickness is greater than effective thickness). G04 PzVI Tiger I  The above only applies to WWII era AP and APC/APCBC, and WWII sub-caliber ammunition. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The long-rod penetrators of today are greatly overmatched, but they bring so much energy to the plate that they penetrate by "ablation": in which both projectile and armor behave like fluids. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Hollow charge also enters the field of fluid dynamics, with a very thin jet penetrating overmatching armor with ease, regardless of obliquity" (Robert Livingston; excerpts of a response to a question posted on the old "Tanker's Forum (Heavy Metal Website)", back in 1998). G04 PzVI Tiger I

The 13. G04 PzVI Tiger I (Tiger) Kompanie, of Panzer Regiment Großdeutschland, reported on the performance of the 88 mm KwK 36 L/56, when their Tigers engaged the T-34: "First round hits were usually achieved at ranges between 800 to 1,000 meters. G04 PzVI Tiger I  At these ranges, the Panzer Granate (they are referring to the PzGr. G04 PzVI Tiger I  39 APCBC ammunition) absolutely penetrated through the frontal armor, and usually still destroyed the engine at the rear of the T-34 tank. G04 PzVI Tiger I  In 80 percent of the cases, shots from the same range hitting the side of the hull toward the rear of the tank resulted in the fuel tanks exploding. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Even at ranges of 1,500 meters and longer, during favorable weather, it is possible to succeed in penetrating the T-34 with minimal expenditure of ammunition" (JENTZ, Thomas L. G04 PzVI Tiger I ; Germany's TIGER Tanks - Tiger I and II: Combat Tactics; op. G04 PzVI Tiger I  cit. G04 PzVI Tiger I ). G04 PzVI Tiger I  Many more reports like this one attest to the precedent arguments on the superior performance of the 88 mm KwK 36 L/56 gun. G04 PzVI Tiger I

The Tiger I, with its 88 KwK 36 L/56 gun, coupled with superior optics, could accurately hit targets at ranges the enemy could not even aim at. G04 PzVI Tiger I  

'''''Accuracy and Penetration Tables for the 8. G04 PzVI Tiger I 8 cm KwK 36 L/56'''''. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The 8. G04 PzVI Tiger I 8 cm KwK 36 L/56 was a very accurate gun capable of first-round hits at over 1,000 meters: the Tiger I actually started first-round killing at 1,200 meters, under combat conditions. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Considering that the Tiger I was nearly impervious to penetration by most tank and anti-tank guns at normal combat ranges (+/- 800 meters), these were the two main assets (Firepower + Armor Protection) that made it possible for the Tiger I to virtually dominate the battlefield. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The long and powerful 88 mm KwK 36 L/56 could out-range and out-shoot nearly all Allied tanks, and this allowed the Tiger I to stand off and engage targets as it chose. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

On 21 July 1943, General der Panzertruppe Breith, commander of the III. G04 PzVI Tiger I Panzer - Korps, issued the following directive: "Based on experience in recent battles, I issue the following instructions for the cooperation of Tigers with other weapons: As a result of its high performance weapon and strong armor, the Tiger should be used primarily against enemy tanks and anti-tank weapons and secondarily, and then only as a complete exception, against infantry units. G04 PzVI Tiger I  As experience has shown, its weapons allow the Tiger to fight enemy tanks at ranges of 2,000 meters and longer, which has especially worked on the morale of the opponent. G04 PzVI Tiger I  As a result of the strong armor, it is possible to close to short range with the enemy tanks without being seriously damaged by the hits. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Still, the Tiger should attempt to start engaging enemy tanks at ranges over 1,000 meters". G04 PzVI Tiger I 

According to Jentz (JENTZ, Thomas L. G04 PzVI Tiger I ; Germany's TIGER Tanks - Tiger I and II: Combat Tactics; op. G04 PzVI Tiger I  cit. G04 PzVI Tiger I ): "These accuracy tables are based on the assumptions that the actual range to the target has been correctly determined and that the distribution of hits is centered on the aiming point. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The first column shows the accuracy obtained during controlled test firing to determine the pattern of dispersion. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The figures in the second column include the variation expected during practice firing due to differences between guns, ammunition, and gunners. G04 PzVI Tiger I  These accuracy tables do not reflect the actual probability of hitting a target under battlefield conditions. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Due to errors in estimating the range and many other factors, the probability of a first hit was much lower than shown in these tables. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, the average, calm gunner, after sensing the tracer from the first round, could achieve the accuracy shown in the second column". G04 PzVI Tiger I

'''Please note that 88 mm KwK 36 L/56 means''': The diameter of the bore (caliber) of this gun is 88 mm, this is a Tank Gun (Kampfwagenkanone), that the year the development of this gun was finalized was 1936, and that the length of the gun equals 56 times the diameter of the bore (caliber) of the same gun. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This measurement was done from the rear face of the breech to the end of the muzzle, not counting the muzzle brake. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This was the main gun installed on the Tiger I. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

As far as the Tiger I is concerned, the two main types of armor piercing ammunition were the APCBC and the APCR. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Armor Piercing Capped, Ballistic Capped (APCBC) round relied not only on its own weight to penetrate the enemy's armor, but was also filled with high explosive that caused great internal damage. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The APCBC round has two caps covering the main body of the round. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The first one is a cap designed for ballistic performance, and is a blunt cap, because a projectile with a blunt nose has less chance to ricochet off inclined armor. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This is covered by the second cap, a sharp one, a "windshield" made of light metal, designed to give the round a better aerodynamic shape. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Armor Piercing Composite Rigid (APCR) round was made with a tungsten core. G04 PzVI Tiger I  For flight performance effects and to aid the shot from shattering against armor plating, the APCR round was surrounded by a ballistic cap. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The APCR rounds had a higher penetration capacity, but were less lethal than the APCBC after penetration, and also had a shorter effective range. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The Tiger I carried 92 rounds of ammunition, although it is known that experienced crews frequently broke the regulations by storing more than that. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The recommended and most usual mix was 50 percent APCBC (Pzgr. G04 PzVI Tiger I 39) and 50 percent HE (Sprenggranaten - high explosive shells). G04 PzVI Tiger I  A few rounds of the rare (due to the shortage of tungsten carbide) APCR (Pzgr. G04 PzVI Tiger I 40) ammunition might be carried for use against the heaviest armored Russian tanks and tank destroyers. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Gr. G04 PzVI Tiger I 39 HL (Hohlgranate) based on the hollow charge principle (HEAT), was less accurate and much less destructive than the APCBC rounds, but could be carried in place of the HE rounds and used either to combat armor or as effective high-explosive ammunition against soft targets. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_17. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

The sights that equipped the Tiger I up to 1944 were the binocular Turmzielfernrohr 9b mounted parallel and on the same axis as the main gun. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Turmzielfernrohr 9b was an articulated binocular sight, with 2. G04 PzVI Tiger I 5x magnification. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The range scale was graduated at 100 meter intervals up to a maximum range of 4,000 meters. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The commander ordered the target selection, type of ammunition, and range. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The gunner observed the tracer and the strike of the round and reported his observations to the commander, who then ordered corrections. G04 PzVI Tiger I  To quickly traverse onto a target, the Tiger I was outfitted with a hydraulic motor for the turret drive. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The hydraulic drive traversed the turret at a maximum rate of 360 degrees in 60 seconds, dependent on engine speed. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Placing the target on the point of a triangle allowed the gunner to aim without obstructing the view of the target. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The triangle height and separation distances, in mils, were used as an aid in estimating the range to the target by comparing them with the size of the target. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Tiger gunners knew the size of their targets from target tables and later, by practice, instinctively knowing distances. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The pattern in the right reticle also contained the 7 triangles plus adjustable range scales that allowed the gunner to register the exact range to the target. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The gunner adjusted the range through this sight by lowering or raising the gun to set the aiming sight again on target. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The range scale was graduated at 100 meter intervals out to a range of 3,000 meters for the APCR rounds, 4,000 meters for the APCBC rounds, and up to 6,000 meters for the HE rounds. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The 88 mm KwK 36L/56 gun had a very-high muzzle velocity and the shell traveled in a stretched arc, which gave the Tiger I more advantages than just penetration power. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Besides providing a higher penetration power, it also allowed a higher margin of error in range guessing. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The gunner could guess wrong up to 200 meters and still hit the target, since aiming too high simply raised the striking point by less than a meter: too little an error to miss a 3 meter high tank when aimed at its center. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

From April 1944 on, the monocular Turmzielfernrohr 9c (sighting telescope) replaced the binocular Turmzielfernrohr 9b. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This sight allowed the gunner to select two magnifications, 2. G04 PzVI Tiger I 5x and 5x. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The lower magnification was intended for target acquisition, as it showed a wider field of view. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The higher magnification allowed precise aiming at longer ranges. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The range scale was graduated in the same way as the Turmzielfernrohr 9b sight; at 100 meters it jumps up to 3,000 meters for APCR rounds, up to 4,000 meters for APCBC rounds, and up to 6,000 meters for HE rounds. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Tiger platoons could open fire (concentrated platoon fire) for effect against stationary targets at up to 3,000 meters. G04 PzVI Tiger I  When firing against moving targets, the rule was to open fire starting at 1,200 meters and up to 2,000 meters. G04 PzVI Tiger I 


'''''Proposed Upgrade'''''

[[File:Tiger_I_with_KwK43_L71_proposal. G04 PzVI Tiger I jpg|200px|center|]]

The Tiger I was proposed arm the stronger 8,8 cm Kw. G04 PzVI Tiger I K. G04 PzVI Tiger I  43 L/71. G04 PzVI Tiger I  However, there were certain factors that stopped this proposal from being carried out. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

1. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The turret would need a counter weight fitted as well as a weight on the breech of the gun. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

2. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Ammunition storage would require nearly a full rebuild of the ammunition storage racks, it would also make the forward racks unaccessible by the loader reducing the amount of ready storage without rotating the turret 90 degrees to access it. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

3. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Handling of the ammunition in the turret was impossible using the original Tiger turret. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The length of the shell from where the breech sat in the turret the shell was longer than the entry of the breech to the turret aft. G04 PzVI Tiger I  (Basically, the shell couldn't go into the breech due to how close the breech sat near the aft of the turret. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

In addition, the construction of the Tiger II made this proposal redundant. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

== Mobility ==

[[image:PzKpfwVI_photo_18. G04 PzVI Tiger I png‎‎|200px|center|]]

'''''High maneuverability, low operational mobility'''''. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Much have been said about the Tiger's maneuverability, that the Tiger was a "lumbering monster", or that "it could barely move", but that is not exactly the truth. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Tiger I was very maneuverable for its weight and size, and superior to the Sherman in muddy terrain, despite its size and weight, as it had less ground pressure. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This capability was provided by the the combat tracks of 755 mm width, which resulted in a ground pressure of 15. G04 PzVI Tiger I 0 psi, or 1. G04 PzVI Tiger I 05 kg/cm². G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The Tiger I engine was developed by Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Maybach produced the engines for all medium and heavy German tanks. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Tiger's engine, the Maybach HL 210 P45, was a V-12 water-cooled gasoline engine with a capacity of 21. G04 PzVI Tiger I 33 liters and a power output of 650 bhp at 3,000 rpm. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This engine was mounted in a sealed compartment at the rear of the Tiger. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

However, it could not be reliably operated at its maximum power output of 3,000 rpm because the transmission, the Maybach OG 40 12 16 A, with 8 speeds forward and 4 reverse, although a surprisingly light set of controls for the driver, had a tendency to breakdown if adequate preventive maintenance was not done. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The weight of the Tiger (the combat weight was 57 tons) was too much for the German transmissions available at the time. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Since it was not always possible to do this preventive maintenance as required, many Tigers broke down and had to be destroyed and abandoned. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The recommendation was that the driver should not exceed 2,600 rpm when operating the Tiger. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Only the first 250 Tigers received the Maybach HL 210 P45 engine. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

In May, 1943, the Maybach HK 230 P45 engine with two air filters was installed, and the transmission was improved. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The new engine, also a V-12 water-cooled gasoline engine with a capacity of 23. G04 PzVI Tiger I 88 liters, had a power output of 700 bhp at 3,000 rpm. G04 PzVI Tiger I  With this upgrade, the Tiger's performance improved in normal use, but the transmission was still weak for/from the stress of the power generated by the engine moving the weight of the tank at maximum output, and preventive maintenance continued to be an imperative. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Tigers, like all German tanks, used regenerative steering, hydraulically operated; the separate tracks could be turned in opposite directions at the same time, so the Tiger I could neutral steer (pivoting in place) and completely turn around in a distance of 3. G04 PzVI Tiger I 44 meters (11. G04 PzVI Tiger I 28ft). G04 PzVI Tiger I  This was used to surprise many unlucky enemy crews. G04 PzVI Tiger I  As a result of all these facts, the reality is that the Tiger I was not slow at all. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Panzer IVs road speed was 40 km/h and cross-country speed was 20 km/h. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Panzer IIIs (Ausf E to N) road speed was 40 km/h, and cross-country speed was 18 km/h. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Tiger Is road speed was 38 km/h, and cross-country speed was 20 km/h. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

This fact is evidenced by the following excerpt from the Experience Report of the Tiger Abteilung 506, dated 15 January 1944: "During long term operations, which stretched over 12 days, time for care and maintenance of the Tigers was too short and losses were correspondingly high. G04 PzVI Tiger I  On 2 January 1944, the Abteilung went into action with 13 Panzers. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Not a single Tiger was still operational on the evening of 14 January. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The last two Tigers had driven a distance of about 340 kilometers. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Without being given any time for care and servicing, most of them managed to cover 250 kilometers"

But there were still other complications. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Given the characteristics of the Tigers as a battlefield superiority weapon, they were constantly being transferred from one point to the other on the battlefield, and even front to front, as "fire brigades". G04 PzVI Tiger I  Long road marchs resulted in mechanical problems, and Tigers consumed high quantities of precious gasoline (the Tiger had a maximum combat radius of 195 kilometers, using 540 liters of fuel in the process) thus, the preferred method of movement across great distances was by rail. G04 PzVI Tiger I  As the war went on, the German rail net was progressively more and more disrupted by Allied strategic and tactical air attack. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This eventually limited transportation of Tigers by rail to the night. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Rail movement of Tigers, however, involved more complications, because special cars were required to transport Tigers, and the tracks were too wide for rail transport: narrower ones were fitted for normal road and railway transport, where the outer set of road wheels was also removed. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This limited the transfer of Tigers from one sector to another without a great deal of lead time and careful coordination. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Beyond the great additional effort by the crewmen that was required, such a complicated transport process took even more time from the Tiger's combat availability. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This process led in a heavy logistical burden on the Tiger units, as they had to necessarily maintain two sets of tracks for each tank (WILBECK, Christopher W. G04 PzVI Tiger I , op cit). G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The bottom line is that the Tiger had high maneuverability, but low operational mobility. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Tigers were prone to transmission problems if they did not receive adequate periodic maintenance. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This high degree of maintenance required to keep Tigers operational was one of their biggest deficiencies, and usually resulted in a low operational rate of combat-available tanks within the schwere Panzer Abteilungen, especially after long marches or extended periods of combat. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The tendency of the Tigers to break down, coupled with the weight of the tanks, made recovery of broken down Tigers difficult. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The outcome was low operational mobility as a result of those problems, which meant that Tiger units frequently had a very limited radius of action. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Allies exploited this fact during the numerous and frequent operational and strategic withdrawals of the Tiger battalions. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

That, and the overwhelming Allied air power, were the main reasons for the destruction of Tigers, more than any tank versus tank combat, specially on the Western Front. G04 PzVI Tiger I  On the East Front, the main causes of destruction of Tigers were the transmission problems (with consequent abandon and/or destruction by the crews), the Russian air attacks, and being terribly outnumbered and fighting to the very end.

Henschel und Sohn, of Kassel, Germany, was a well-known manufacturer of heavy industrial and railroad equipment, especially railroad locomotives and large dock cranes. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Because of the size and weight of the Tiger, Henschel was considered to be the ideal manufacturer, having all the facilities needed to produce such a heavy vehicle. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Henschel also had a fine engineering staff, and a complete vehicle test facility. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The final assembly hall at Henschel's plant dwarfed the tanks being produced there and the final assembly line was capable of producing several tanks a day. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Although much of the installed equipment on the Tiger was subcontracted, Henschel manufactured most of the major components in their plant. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Hulls, turrets, and other contract items and assemblies were brought into the assembly building where final machining operations and detail assembling were done. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Henschel's facilities allowed the firm to machine the turret rings and other critical areas of the hull within the plant without outside assistance. G04 PzVI Tiger I Like all German Panzers, the Tiger I was subject to continuous changes and additions, as it became obvious that improvements could be made in the performance and effectiveness of the Tiger. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Gradually, the various problems reported were worked out, although some were never solved completely. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The problems with ice and snow freezing on the interleaved road wheels were not solved until the introduction of the Tiger II with overlapping, not interleaved, road wheels In May, 1943, the Maybach HK 230 P45 engine with two air filters was installed in place of the Maybach HL 210 P45, and the transmission was improved. G04 PzVI Tiger I  With this upgrade, the Tiger's performance improved in normal use. G04 PzVI Tiger I  In July 1943, the turret was extensively redesigned. G04 PzVI Tiger I  A new commander's cupola with periscopes and a swivel hatch was installed, and along with other modifications, an improved spring counter-balance connected with a chain was installed for the 88 mm main gun. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Starting in September, 1943, Zimmerit anti-magnetic coating was applied at the factory to all upright surfaces that could be reached by a man standing on the ground. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The surface was rippled to increase the distance to the steel surface without increasing the weight of the coating. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

From January 1944 on, the Nahverteidigungswaffe (close defense weapon) was mounted on the turret roof. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This weapon could fire smoke cartridges, signal cartridges, and grenades, but due to shortages, was not mounted on the Tiger I until March 1944. G04 PzVI Tiger I  In February 1944, steel road wheels with internal rubber cushioning, adopted from the Tiger II, were mounted in the Tiger I. G04 PzVI Tiger I  These were chosen because of their ability to bear the weight of heavy armored vehicles. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

From March 1944 on, the 25 mm roof plate was increased to 40 mm, to prevent penetration by large caliber artillery shells (over 150 mm), and the loader's hatch, originally designed for the Tiger II turret, was installed in the thicker turret roof. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Finally, in April 1944, The monocular Turmzielfernrohr 9c sighting telescope replaced the previously used binocular Turmzielfernrohr 9b. G04 PzVI Tiger I  While the Germans stayed close to their original production schedule for the Tiger, it is interesting to note that, for example, during Operation Zitadelle (the Kursk Offensive - July 1943), there were a total of only 133 Tigers available at the start of the offensive; 45 serving with sPzAbt. G04 PzVI Tiger I 503, 13 with 13. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kp. G04 PzVI Tiger I SSPzRgt1 (LSSAH), 14 with 8. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kp. G04 PzVI Tiger I SSPzRgt2 (Das Reich), 15 with s. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kp. G04 PzVI Tiger I SSPzRgt3 (Totenkopf), 15 with 13. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kp. G04 PzVI Tiger I PzRgtGD (Großdeutschland), and 31 with sPzAbt. G04 PzVI Tiger I 505. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

A total of 19 Tigers arrived as replacements during Operation Zitadelle; 5 for 13. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kp. G04 PzVI Tiger I SSPzRgt1 (LSSAH), and 14 for sPzAbt. G04 PzVI Tiger I  505. G04 PzVI Tiger I  From 5 July to 20 July 1943, 13 Tigers were lost (total writeoffs): 4 by sPzAbt. G04 PzVI Tiger I 503, 1 by 13. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kp. G04 PzVI Tiger I SSPzRgt1 (LSSAH), 1 by 8. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kp. G04 PzVI Tiger I SSPzRgt2 (Das Reich), 1 by s. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kp. G04 PzVI Tiger I SSPzRgt3 (Totenkopf), and 6 by sPzAbt. G04 PzVI Tiger I 505. G04 PzVI Tiger I

The Tiger dominated the battlefield, and this occurred basically because it managed to maintain a stand-off ability made possible by; a combination of thick armor and a high-velocity, very accurate gun coupled with superior optics, thus being capable of first hits at ranges well beyond 1. G04 PzVI Tiger I 000 meters. G04 PzVI Tiger I  As it was, the Tiger could choose its targets at will, and destroy them at ranges they either couldn't hit, or if they could hit, couldn't defeat the Tiger's thick armor. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The Tiger I maintained this stand off capability until nearly the end of the war, as it was only outclassed by the Russian Josef Stalin (IS) heavy tank. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

On the other hand, Tigers were maintenance-intensive tanks and prone to mechanic failures if periodic maintenance procedures were not done. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Because of that, plus the weight of the tank, they had low operational mobility: a problem that was magnified during retreats, when damaged or broken Tigers couldn't be recovered and had to be destroyed by their crews. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

By February 1944, sPzAbt. G04 PzVI Tiger I 502 had 71 Tiger I tanks. G04 PzVI Tiger I  At the same time, sPzAbt. G04 PzVI Tiger I 503, 507, and 509 had respectively 69, 56, and 58 Tigers. G04 PzVI Tiger I  This was due to transfers from other units training with the Tiger II, or due to the delivery of the last production Tiger I models. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Tiger I production reached its peak between January and May 1944. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Regardless, the maximum degree of success attained by Tiger units was in limited and/or localized tactical superiority. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The truth was that the German industry simply couldn't produce Tigers in sufficient numbers to make any difference in the big picture: it was a task well beyond wartime German industrial capabilities. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Just as a comparison on production capabilities, the Russians produced 23,937 T-34/76s from 1942 to 1945. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The American Pershing tank was built at a rate of 1,350 tanks over a six month period. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

When production ceased in June 1945, 49,234 Sherman tanks had been built: more than all the German tank production during the entire war. G04 PzVI Tiger I  In the end, it was this difference in production philosophy and faster Allied production that made the difference between defeat and victory. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The real failure of the German heavy tank was that they exceeded the capability of German industry to produce them in sufficient numbers. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

All this said and done, the Tiger was very sucessful in fullfilling its doctrinal mission, to destroy other tanks, and its reputation grew on the battlefield as the war raged on. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The basis for this is the kill/loss ratio attained by the Tiger battalions. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The overall ratio for all Tiger battalions is a respectable 5. G04 PzVI Tiger I 74 to 1 kill ratio. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

The Tiger I was phased out in 1944. G04 PzVI Tiger I  By August of that year, 1,300+ had been made: not many, in view of their reputation and effect on Allied morale. G04 PzVI Tiger I  Perhaps this is the best epitaph the Tigers could have. G04 PzVI Tiger I

1) The Pz. G04 PzVI Tiger I Kpfw. G04 PzVI Tiger I  VI H Ausf. G04 PzVI Tiger I  H2 turret was only meant for the VK 36. G04 PzVI Tiger I 01 (H), which is the Tiger I prototype. G04 PzVI Tiger I 
2) The 88 mm KwK 43 gun only existed as a proposal. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It was rejected before it even became a project for the following reasons:
* The turret would need a counter weight fitted as well as a weight on the breech of the gun. G04 PzVI Tiger I 
* Ammunition storage would require nearly a full rebuild of the ammunition storage racks, it would also make the forward racks inaccessible by the loader reducing the amount of ready storage without rotating the turret 90 degrees to access it. G04 PzVI Tiger I 
* Handling of the ammunition in the turret was impossible using the original Tiger turret. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The length of the shell from where the breech sat in the turret was longer than the entry of the breech to the turret aft. G04 PzVI Tiger I  (Basically, the shell could not go into the breech due to how close the breech sat near the aft of the turret. G04 PzVI Tiger I 

Therefore the KwK 43 configuration on the Tiger as depicted in-game is fictitious. G04 PzVI Tiger I  It would require a new turret and a rework of the hull, hence why the project was never done. G04 PzVI Tiger I  The turret ring was large enough to handle the recoil, but the above problems basically make it impossible to just put the gun into a Tiger's turret. G04 PzVI Tiger I
