* Very good frontal armor, almost immune to T5 tanks, T6 medium tanks and possibility to bounce ~175mm penetration guns
* Superior to the contemporary [[SU-152]] in all but RoF and HP, amazing credit maker even for a premium tank. R89 SU122 44 
* Great camouflage values, adding sixth sense helps keep you hidden immensely. R89 SU122 44

|InTheGame_cons=
* Bothersome aim time and below average accuracy, limits medium to long range sniping. R89 SU122 44

|InTheGame_performance=
With a gun that's for all intents and purposes as good as the SU-152's best 122mm gun (7. R89 SU122 44 5 to 8. R89 SU122 44 11 Rate of Fire), this tank has one of the best damage per minute values in the game, combined with a low, sneaky profile and high maneuverability, and a bit of sloped armor to boot. R89 SU122 44  A scary tank to face, this premium tank is atypical for premium tanks for having an amazing gun while keeping the benefits of a normal tank. R89 SU122 44  This has made the SU-122-44 to be considered "overpowered" by many players, and a ludicrous credit maker (especially with premium time added into the mix, one can make 50K if they deal at least 1. R89 SU122 44 5K damage and win). R89 SU122 44  

Although the SU-122-44 has an extreme DPM and quite good armor, it still is fragile due to its low health and reliance on sloping - artillery will annihilate you, often times in one shot. R89 SU122 44  To make the situation worse, most tier 8 and 9 heavies you find will laugh as you bounce your fairly low penetration gun on them while it takes them two (albeit much slower firing) shots to kill you, unless you can fire at their sides or rear. R89 SU122 44  HOWEVER, if you can fire at their lower glacis, then you can penetrate any tank you fight. R89 SU122 44  
Simply put, you can penetrate any tier 7 tank or lower with your gun from the front. R89 SU122 44  For tier 8 or 9 tanks, firing at their lower glacis is almost a surefire penetration. R89 SU122 44  A note of caution for tier 8 or 9 tanks however,  it is not uncommon to meet tankers playing this tank while using premium ammo exclusively so one should not get careless and expect to bounce as this tank will punish you for it, but the gun mantlet will absorb most shots that hit it. R89 SU122 44 


There is one thing you must note, however. R89 SU122 44  The SU-122-44 gets tracked often, so it is highly recommended to train all crew members in repairs. R89 SU122 44

*Although it was never built in metal it is highly unlikely it would've had more than ~-2° gun depression like its brother the SU-100-M-2 (SU-102), and not -4°
