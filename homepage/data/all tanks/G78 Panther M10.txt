{{TankData|Tank= Panther/M10
|The Panther/M10 is more or less identical to a ''historical'' Panther G tank, featuring the well-known long 75 L70. G78 Panther M10  Like the Panther, the Panther/M10 is a medium tank with somewhat mediocre mobility and firepower. G78 Panther M10  Armor is arguably above-average for a medium tank, but is generally not reliable. G78 Panther M10 
At a glance, it seems somewhat lackluster even for a T7 medium tank. G78 Panther M10  However, the Panther/M10 features limited matchmaking - which from 9. G78 Panther M10 18 onwards means it, at worst, will see five T8s. G78 Panther M10  Generally expect single-tier T7 and 5+10 T7+T6 battles. G78 Panther M10  Furthermore, like the normal Panther, it features a ''huge'' hitpoint pool of 1300, equivalent to many T8 medium tanks. G78 Panther M10  
Gun-wise, using the same one as T6 medium tanks (or even T5 TDs) might not seem too good. G78 Panther M10  DPM is not much better than e. G78 Panther M10 g. G78 Panther M10  a VK3001D, but it gets ''far'' better gun handling - better than a Comet equipped with a vertical stabilizer. G78 Panther M10  This, combined with the HP pool, makes it a formidable opponent on the battlefield. G78 Panther M10  Medium-long range combat is recommended, conserving the HP pool for the mid-late game. G78 Panther M10

* Great accuracy and comparatively little dispersion on the move or on turret rotation. G78 Panther M10  Arguably best in class, close to e. G78 Panther M10 g. G78 Panther M10  a T-54. G78 Panther M10 
* High top speed; combined with weight and armor makes for a good battering ram. G78 Panther M10 
* Preferential matchmaking (tier 8 max, no tier 9 battles)
* Improved armor profile from a Panther G: has armor screens on turret, hull glacis and rear, also no commander cupola
* Highest hit points out of all tier 7 medium tanks, can efficiently exchange HP when top tier. G78 Panther M10 


|InTheGame_cons=
* Mediocre hard gun stats: low penetration at tier especially compared to the 75mm/L100. G78 Panther M10 
* 2nd worst view range of all tier 7 mediums and bad camo values: relies on distraction rather than stealth to get side shots
* Low mobility for a medium tank due to overweight and mediocre ground resistance values
* Somewhat Jack-of-all-trades, barely excels or even good at any

In some ways the tank is like a hybrid of the weighty armour and gun maneuvering-dispersion of the Panther, with the Leopard 1 Line's VK 3001D's matchmaking and agility. G78 Panther M10  [[Pz. G78 Panther M10 Kpfw. G78 Panther M10  V Panther]] drivers will realize that the M10 Ersatz variant has not only hard but also soft differences from the normal tank, notably the lack of the comical L/100 gun and a true Schmalturm (although with the mantlet, the true difference in armour between the turrets is quite small on either tank), but also higher traverse speed. G78 Panther M10   Accordingly, the Panther M10 has improved handling, accuracy, and firerate with the undertiered L/70 gun, limiting it to side shots and flanking against its highest tier opponents at tier 8. G78 Panther M10  The bonus is the tank's low repair cost and high credit income makes it a better credit maker compared to the other tanks. G78 Panther M10 

The Panther/M10 is the first tank to sport a different color from the rest of the tanks of its nation. G78 Panther M10  Instead of German grey, it is American olive drab; and as of 8. G78 Panther M10 6, it sports the American star rather than the Iron Cross. G78 Panther M10  As of 8. G78 Panther M10 9, American camouflage patterns and inscriptions are available for it, and it also receives stars on the barrel instead of triple rings for it's Marks of Excellence. G78 Panther M10 

With this tank's strengths and weaknesses it can attempt take on most tier 7 or lower tanks alone, but be wary of concentrated fire. G78 Panther M10  A big problem for this tank is the combination of low alpha and average penetration, making any frontal assault against thickly armored tanks highly unfavorable, such as the Obj. G78 Panther M10  252U and TS-5, with their sturdy armor and hard hitting weaponry. G78 Panther M10  Even though this tank has only an average of 135 damage per shot, patience and strategy can still deal a good amount of damage even to tanks such as the T29 or Tiger I, especially if you can distract and flank them or lure them into a killing ground. G78 Panther M10  Going for tracking shots is typically the best option to ensure you can continue to deal damage. G78 Panther M10 

As a support unit, you should always be watching the flanks and trying to keep up with and get around the movements of your enemies if possible. G78 Panther M10  Here, the good turret traverse speed, firerate and accuracy makes it excellent at countering scouts. G78 Panther M10  Keep in mind that many potent heavy tanks are available at tiers 7 and 8, and rushing the M10 on the front lines will result in a swift trip back to the garage. G78 Panther M10  Get around your enemy and stay at range. G78 Panther M10  This tank excels especially when played in a wolf pack of two or more mediums in a platoon. G78 Panther M10  A wolf pack is able to deal considerable damage to enemy tanks that have been separated from their allies, and often consists of flanking and overwhelming isolated targets. G78 Panther M10 

Do not judge its armor too harshly - it is able to bounce shots from many vehicles in a similar fashion to the original Panther in game, even being able to occasionally bounce the KV-85/IS' 122mm guns with a good angle. G78 Panther M10  Unlike the Panther, the Panther/M10 has spaced armour over the upper glacis and the turret sides, which makes it more resistent against HE and HEAT shells. G78 Panther M10  The Panther/M10 also lacks a cupola; it was historically removed as part of its disguise. G78 Panther M10  This is reflected in its view range, but makes it strong in hull-down locations. G78 Panther M10  The gun mantlet has a habit of eating shots, but don't place too much trust into it. G78 Panther M10  Due to its high profile, its camouflage values are a bit lacking. G78 Panther M10  If you're using it as a dedicated sniper, training the [[Crew#Skills_and_Perks|Camouflage]] skill is a definite requirement along with camo paint. G78 Panther M10 

The Optics + Vents combo will not allow you to max the viewrange on the vehicle, though with a very good crew (with BiA and view range skills) you can still reach 440m - enough to compensate for the lack of camo values. G78 Panther M10  Binoculars remain a viable choice for the tank if the crew isn't quite there yet. G78 Panther M10

In late 1944, Hitler was planning one last desperate offensive to attempt to obtain a separate peace from the Western Allies. G78 Panther M10  The Wacht am Rhein plan was designed to split the British and American armies as well as capture Antwerp. G78 Panther M10  This battle, of course, became known as the Battle of the Bulge in the West. G78 Panther M10  As a part of the Wacht am Rhein plan was Operation Greif under the command of Otto Skorzeny. G78 Panther M10  English speaking German commandos in American uniforms and using as much American equipment as possible would infiltrate American positions to seize bridges across the Meuse. G78 Panther M10  This unit, innoculously entitled Panzer Brigade 150 was supposed to consist of 3,300 men, 15 Sherman tanks, 32 armored cars (U. G78 Panther M10 S. G78 Panther M10 ), 198 trucks, and 147 jeeps which had been requisition from OB West. G78 Panther M10  Unfortunately for the brigade, the required equipment never materialized. G78 Panther M10  Panzer Brigade 150 went into battle with only about 2,500 men and a dozen tanks and assault guns. G78 Panther M10  Several of the tanks were Panther usf. G78 Panther M10   's extensively modified to look like U. G78 Panther M10 S. G78 Panther M10  M-10 tank destroyers. G78 Panther M10 

==Vehicle modifications==

'''Turret'''
[[image:Top_view_of_Panther_tank_disguised_as_U. G78 Panther M10 S. G78 Panther M10 _M10_gun_carriage,_showing_hatch_covers_used_in_place_of_cupola. G78 Panther M10 jpg|thumb|200px|right|Panther tank disguised as U. G78 Panther M10 S. G78 Panther M10  M10 gun carriage, showing hatch covers used in place of turret]]
The turret was disguised by using five pieces of sheet metal, two of which were cut to resemble the distinctive sides of the M10 turret and then were flanged on the edges, bent to shape, and stiffened with small angle iron. G78 Panther M10  The gun shield was carefully formed from another sheet to the exact shape of the M10 shield, and a hole was made to the right of the gun hole in the shield for the co-axial M. G78 Panther M10 G. G78 Panther M10  34, a hole which does not exist in the M10 shield. G78 Panther M10  Two pieces of sheet metal made up the rear of the turret, one representing the bottom slant surface of the rear and one representing the counterweight. G78 Panther M10  The pieces representing the sides and rear were joined together and braced with angle iron, and the whole was attached to the turret. G78 Panther M10  The false gun shield was attached to the Panther gun shield, and all the lifting rings, brackets, extra-armor studs, etc. G78 Panther M10 , found on the M10 turret were carefully duplicated and welded to the false turret. G78 Panther M10 

'''False Bow'''

Approximately four pieces of sheet metal, shaped to imitate as closely as possible the contours of the M10 bow, made up the false bow, necessary because the Panther bow is bulkier than the M10. G78 Panther M10  The false bottom was shaped to give the characteristic appearance of the front drive sprocket housing of the M10, and the top was shaped carefully and various component pieces attached to the front of the tank. G78 Panther M10  All the  brackets, lifting rings, towing devises, etc. G78 Panther M10 , of the M10 bow were also imitated. G78 Panther M10  A square opening was cut in the false bow to permit the use of the bow M. G78 Panther M10 G. G78 Panther M10  34, but a removable cover attached with a small chain was made for this opening. G78 Panther M10 

'''False Rear and Sides'''
[[image:Rear_view_showing_false_tail_plate. G78 Panther M10 _Note_exhausts_and_dummy_fittings. G78 Panther M10 jpg|thumb|200px|left|Panther/M10, eventually all were destroyed by enemy fire]]

The false rear was made of sheet metal. G78 Panther M10  It was a faithful duplicate of the M10 rear except for two holes to permit the twin exhaust elbows of the Panther to protrude. G78 Panther M10  An attempt was made to imitate the skirting  armor of the M10 which appears to hang lower than the side armor of the Panther and is bevelled in at the bottom. G78 Panther M10  A long flat strip of sheet metal was attached to the sides parallel to the ground, and a vertical sheet strip was attached at right angles to this strip to give the appearance of low skirting armor. G78 Panther M10  While a few of the jeep commando teams easily slipped through American sentries and roamed freely behind American lines, but the rest of the unit languished with Sixth Panzer Armee. G78 Panther M10  When it became apparent that no breakthrough was going to occur, the "Ersatz M-10's" were committed along with the rest of the brigade as a normal combat unit. G78 Panther M10  Ultimately, all of the vehicles were destroyed or disabled in the fighting. G78 Panther M10 

The following is an excerpt from the log of one of the commanders of the disguised Panthers:
Day 12: The Americans STILL have not suspected that I an not, in fact, an M10 - but rather a poorly disguised Panther. G78 Panther M10  They smile and wave and bring us coffee. G78 Panther M10  I am flummoxed and ready to yell "hey stupids, I look nothing like an M10!!! Unless. G78 Panther M10 . G78 Panther M10 . G78 Panther M10  they know the ruse and are playing along for some diabolical reason. G78 Panther M10  I fear my crew is starting to think that they are Americans too. G78 Panther M10  Mien God - I wrote this in English! Yes I DO want to super-size my meal for $1 more!!

Muzzle brake is missing (see intelligence report under 'Historical Gallery'). G78 Panther M10  Images showing the tank without its muzzle brake was after they had been removed by American troops in the aftermath of the battle. G78 Panther M10  It was common practice for American troops to remove muzzle brakes from abandoned German tanks, probably in the event that the Germans were able to recover the tank, they cannot fire the gun lest they suffer the greater recoil effect. G78 Panther M10 
*Actual name is Ersatz M10. G78 Panther M10 
*Contrary to the in-game description, the Panther/M10 actually saw action on 21 December 1944; February 1945 was a month after the Battle of the Bulge had ended. G78 Panther M10
