This tank is arguably the purest scout in the game. F97 ELC EVEN 90  When equipped with a camo net and a camo-trained crew it can sit in a bush and remain undetected until the enemy accidentally rams it. F97 ELC EVEN 90  Even when moving, it will only be spotted at close range. F97 ELC EVEN 90  When played cautiously, it can be very effective. F97 ELC EVEN 90  However, all care must be taken not to reveal its location. F97 ELC EVEN 90  It lacks the armour to bounce any incoming fire and is extremely vulnerable to HE shells exploding nearby. F97 ELC EVEN 90  It also has limited mobility as a result of its underpowered engine, which makes it difficult to reach high speeds or maintain speed when moving through rough terrain. F97 ELC EVEN 90  Its tiny profile will sometimes allow you to dodge shells, but this tank is far from an armored car like the EBR, and it's mostly pure luck if an enemy misses, so staying hidden should always be top priority. F97 ELC EVEN 90  When played cautiously, this can be a rewarding, though unforgiving tank, but it is not suitable for inexperienced players. F97 ELC EVEN 90
