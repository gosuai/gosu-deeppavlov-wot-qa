| Arguably one of the most controversial premium tanks to ever added in World of Tanks, the '''Object 252U''' (also known as the '''Defender''' due to its [[tank:R134_Object_252K|premium reskinned variants]]) is essentially a much better version of the [[IS-6]] that had almost everything the IS-6 lacked. R134 Object 252U  With the combination of a tier 10 levels of armor, a powerful high-alpha gun, and decent mobility, the Object 252U is a robust powerhouse that can tip the balance of the team in every game it has been a part of.

In some ways, this tank resembles the old (pre 0. R134 Object 252U 9. R134 Object 252U 3) version of the KV-1S. R134 Object 252U  It has an extremely powerful, but very slow-firing gun that can take out most enemies with a few shots. R134 Object 252U  Also, unlike many Russian heavy tanks, it has good penetration on its standard ammunition. R134 Object 252U  	 
The main downside of this gun is the long reload time. R134 Object 252U  This is exacerbated by the poor gun handling, which will cause misses at mid to long range. R134 Object 252U  The armor is very strong, being both thick and well-sloped. R134 Object 252U  From the front, its main weaknesses are the lower glacis, which is large compared to other pike-nosed tanks such as the [[IS-3]] and the [[110]] and can be penetrated by premium rounds and the two cupolas on top of the turret. R134 Object 252U  From the side, the armor just above the tracks can be penetrated easily by almost any gun it encounters. R134 Object 252U  Alternatively, the side of the hull in general can be reliably penetrated by any gun that has more than 175 mm penetration (basically any tier 7 and higher). R134 Object 252U  The best way to play this tank is to side-scrape and trade shots at fairly close range, using the massive alpha damage of the BL-13 gun to overwhelm opponents. R134 Object 252U  However, the player should take care not to become isolated as the low rate of fire makes fighting multiple opponents a tricky proposition. R134 Object 252U  The easiest way to counter it, is to flank. R134 Object 252U

|History= For the first part of its history please go to [[IS-6]](object 252/253)
In late November 1944, the IS-6 was radically redesigned. R134 Object 252U  This is linked to research from NII-48. R134 Object 252U  The tank received a new hull with a pike front and a new turret. R134 Object 252U  Since the IS-6 had no future in late 1944, the modernization project stopped there and it was never built in metal. R134 Object 252U  The time spent on the tank was not wasted: work on a new tank began in the winter of 1945 with it as the foundation. R134 Object 252U
