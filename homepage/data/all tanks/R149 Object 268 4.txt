{{TankData|Tank=Object 268 Version 4
|Replaced [[Object 263]]'s position in 9. R149 Object 268 4 22 patch. R149 Object 268 4  The '''Object 268 Version 4''' (often shortened to '''"268 V4"''', and also known as '''"Bobject"''') generates a considerable amount of controversy about rapid-firing Soviet tank destroyers line by turned the whole line into slow-firing, "high" alpha Assault Tank. R149 Object 268 4 

However, the Object 268 Version 4 vehicle takes the definition of "Assault Tank" to the whole new level. R149 Object 268 4   It has an insane combination of armor and speed that makes up this vehicle. R149 Object 268 4  It can lead a charge to enemy front, block every hit from enemies, counter them with a 152mm boomstick, and even ram enemies with its medium tank speed and heavy tank weight. R149 Object 268 4 

Still, it suffers from some downsides shared with other Soviet tanks; poor accuracy(on paper), and low DPM. R149 Object 268 4

This tank, even after update 1. R149 Object 268 4 02, still one of the strongest machines in the entire game. R149 Object 268 4  Possessing an excellent combination of characteristics, both medium and heavy tank tactics are allowed in this tank. R149 Object 268 4

|History= 

The Object 268 version 4 is an SPG developed from the base of the Object 730, which itself later became the T-10M. R149 Object 268 4 


==Armament==
The initial armament chosen for what became the Object 268 was the 152mm M53 gun. R149 Object 268 4  This gun had a muzzle velocity of 760m/s and was developed by factory #172's design bureau in parallel with the shorter 152mm M31 and M48, both of which were planned for earlier heavy self-propelled guns but ended up cancelled and never built. R149 Object 268 4  Unlike them, the M53 was built along with its SPG, the Object 116 aka the SU-152P, in 1948. R149 Object 268 4  The vehicle's trials showed that it was not accurate enough to meet specifications, and so was rejected for production. R149 Object 268 4  The vehicle itself was preserved and can be seen in Patriot Park. R149 Object 268 4 

The M53 cannon was used as a basis for a new SPG project, which was later designated the Object 268. R149 Object 268 4  According to preliminary calculations, the muzzle velocity of its shells would be 740 m/s. R149 Object 268 4  The M53 was mixed with some parts from the M62-T 122 mm tank gun. R149 Object 268 4  The overall mass of this system with no official name was 5100 kg. R149 Object 268 4 

==Version 2==
Version #2 of the new SPG had a rear fighting compartment, which allowed the reduction of the hull length of 6675 mm. R149 Object 268 4  Since the entire from of the vehicle was taken by the engine and transmission, the driver sat in the fighting compartment, to the right. R149 Object 268 4  The driver's visibility with this layout was not great. R149 Object 268 4 

These inconveniences were balanced out by the relatively short overhang of the barrel, only 2300 mm. R149 Object 268 4  The front of the casemate was 150-180 mm thick, the sides were 90 mm thick. R149 Object 268 4  The upper front plate was only 75 mm thick, but sloped at 75 degrees. R149 Object 268 4  The vehicle was well protected. R149 Object 268 4  The crew consisted of four men. R149 Object 268 4  In order to ease the loader's job, shells were stored in a loading drum behind the gun. R149 Object 268 4 

The draft of this variant, alongside the draft of the turreted Version 3, was created on April 25, 1952. R149 Object 268 4  It should be noted that these were created before the final draft of the tactical-technical requirements was finished, and they never officially carried the 268 index. R149 Object 268 4 

==Version 4==
The redesigned version of the 2nd variant which was indexed #4 was finished on December 18th, 1952. R149 Object 268 4  This design already had the index 268, and the chief designer was listed as Zh. R149 Object 268 4 Ya. R149 Object 268 4  Kotin. R149 Object 268 4  Externally, the 4th variant was similar to the 2nd, but the changes were significant. R149 Object 268 4 

First of all, the length of the hull was increased to 6900 mm, almost the same as on the Object 730. R149 Object 268 4  The length of the barrel overhang was reduced by 150 mm. R149 Object 268 4  The sloped rear of the casemate was straightened out, which increased the available size. R149 Object 268 4  These changes were necessary, as the new technical requirements were for a crew of 5. R149 Object 268 4 

The new crew member was a second loader, positioned behind the commander. R149 Object 268 4  The commander received a new cupola with a rangefinder and a machinegun with a curved barrel. R149 Object 268 4  The driver's station was redesigned, and he received new observation devices. R149 Object 268 4  The loading drum was left alone, but the project authors noted that the increased fighting compartment size meant that an even more powerful gun could be used. R149 Object 268 4  In parallel with the increased fighting compartment size, the armour protection was increased. R149 Object 268 4  The lower front plate was thickened to 160 mm. R149 Object 268 4  The front of the casemate stayed at 180 mm, but 160 mm thick cheeks were positioned at a sharp angle. R149 Object 268 4 The mass of the vehicle remained under 50 tons. R149 Object 268 4 

In January 1953, Variant 4, along with Variant 5 (which itself was a modified version of Variant 3), were submitted  to the GBTU Scientific-Technical Committee and Ministry of Transport and Heavy Machinebuilding. R149 Object 268 4  After studying them, member of the committee decided that both projects required substantial changes to the hull of the T-10M that the SPG's were built off of and were cancelled. R149 Object 268 4  The only Object 268 that did end up being built was not ready until 1956, using the newer and considerably shorter (but with about the same muzzle velocity) 152mm M64.
