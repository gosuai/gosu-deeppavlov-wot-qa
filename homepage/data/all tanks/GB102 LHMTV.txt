The LHMTV, as with the rest of the British light tanks, relies heavily on its camouflage to be effective. GB102 LHMTV  With low DPM, unintimidating alpha, and poor armor, this vehicle is entirely incapable of brawling. GB102 LHMTV  Your best chance if forced into a direct engagement is to simply run for help. GB102 LHMTV  Though if your options are limited, you should look for shots of opportunity on opponents who are reloading or distracted, utilizing your good mobility, gun depression, and workable gun handling to limit exposure whenever possible. GB102 LHMTV  Additionally, reverse sidescraping may be useful, not for the armor, but simply because it limits exposure and simultaneously maximizes acceleration and speed in pulling into cover.

Vision control maps such as Prokhrovka, Malinovka, and Steppes are where this tank is in its element. GB102 LHMTV  Camouflage values are superb with camouflage net, camo skill on the crew, and camo paint, and paired with heavy abuse of soft cover, double bush mechanics, and close attention to distance, the LHMTV is able to continually engage without being spotted, where other tanks would be forced to relocate or disengage. GB102 LHMTV  Though in now way mitigating the DPM disadvantage in a direct engagement, it results in a slow but steady pace of damage, and maximizes the vehicle's role of spotting and peripheral engage.

Although a heavy investment in credits or time and boosters, a 5 skill Commander takes this tank from extremely poor to situationally excellent, and is heavily recommended. GB102 LHMTV
