|The Tetrarch was given as a New Years gift from Wargaming at the beginning of 2012 and has since appeared in gift shop bundles on a few occasions. R84 Tetrarch LL   Historically a [[Britain|British]] design, it was one of a number models provided to the [[USSR]] under the Lend-Lease Act and therefore appears in the USSR tech tree. R84 Tetrarch LL   Though the Tetrarch is extremely fragile, its incredible speed and powerful armament make it a highly dangerous tank capable of damaging anything it meets. R84 Tetrarch LL

The Tetrarch is a tank that combines gameplay aspects of [[Light Tanks|light tanks]] and [[Tank Destroyers|tank destroyers]] of its tier. R84 Tetrarch LL   Its 2-pounder gun has more than A LOT of penetration to deal with most tier II-III enemies, if not all of them because of its superb APCR rounds, and is great for sniping. R84 Tetrarch LL   Unlike many other snipers at the tier however, the Tetrarch is incredibly fast and maneuverable. R84 Tetrarch LL   This, combined with its turret-mounted armament means that the Tetrarch can quickly relocate to different sniping positions or flank unsuspecting enemies easily. R84 Tetrarch LL   This combination of speed and firepower make it a very effective tank when played correctly, many times even in in tier III games. R84 Tetrarch LL 

Despite its strong points, the Tetrarch is not without its drawbacks. R84 Tetrarch LL   With little to no armor and a small hitpoint pool, an exposed Tetrarch will not survive long against autoloaders, machine guns, and anything shooting large HE shells. R84 Tetrarch LL   For this reason, the Tetrarch is usually best played at a distance. R84 Tetrarch LL   Unfortunately, while the Tetrarch is adept at taking out targets from such a distance, it is usually dependent on its team to spot them. R84 Tetrarch LL   The Tetrarch's poor spotting range often necessitates the use of [[Equipment#Coated_Optics|coated optics]] to see targets at a safe distance. R84 Tetrarch LL   Another thing worth noting is the Tetrarch's low ground clearance, which leaves it prone to bottoming-out on rough terrain and slows it down considerably when this happens.

What equipment a player chooses depends mostly on how aggressively they plan on playing the tank. R84 Tetrarch LL   Players who chose to play the Tetrarch more as a stationary sniper will benefit more from the extra concealment and view range provided by the coated optics. R84 Tetrarch LL  The third slot in such an equipment build can be occupied by either the enhanced gun laying drive (to counter the large aim bloom after shots) or vents to provide a small boost to all attributes. R84 Tetrarch LL 

Players who chose to play the Tetrarch more aggressively should try to use equipment that increases survavibility,like the spall liner or toolbox. R84 Tetrarch LL   The decrease in aim time provided by an enhanced gun laying drive will radically decrease the Tetrarch's high aim spread when on the move. R84 Tetrarch LL

R84 Tetrarch LL  Interest in the Mk VII began again in 1941 when it was decided to use it as an air transportable tank. R84 Tetrarch LL  Series production of the Tetrarch was resumed and continued from 1941 to 1942. R84 Tetrarch LL  Total production amounted to 177 vehicles. R84 Tetrarch LL  The Tetrarch saw limited use by British troops in battle during the years 1942-1945 and remained in service after the war until the end of the 1940s.
