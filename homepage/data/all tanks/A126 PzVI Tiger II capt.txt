|InTheGame_pros=
- Same armor layout as the original [[Tank:G16_PzVIB_Tiger_II|Tiger II]] with top turret, which proved to be very strong against tier 7 opponents

- High penetrating gun for its tier, able to penetrating any opponents it face when placed at the top tier in a match

- High view range, can snipe rather well

- Cheap ammunition cost; good credit earner

|InTheGame_cons= 
- Low HP pool for its size (1300), vulnerable against SPGs

- Shared the same weakspot as the original Tiger II, lower plate and side armor were an obvious weakspots

- Overall mobility is horrid! Worsen than the original counterpart; sluggish hull and turret traverses, and poor p/w ratio

- Large size and rather poor camouflage ratings

- Poor rate of fire for its alpha, generally poor DPM as well as worsened accuracy

The Tiger II is a German heavy tank of the Second World War. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  The final official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  B, often shortened to Tiger B. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  The ordnance inventory designation was Sd. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt Kfz. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  182. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  It is also known under the informal name Königstiger (the German name for the Bengal tiger), often translated literally as Royal Tiger, or somewhat incorrectly as King Tiger by Allied soldiers, especially by American forces. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt 

The Tiger II was the successor to the Tiger I, combining the latter's thick armor with the armor sloping used on the Panther medium tank. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  The tank weighed almost 70 tons, and was protected by 100 to 185 mm (3. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt 9 to 7. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt 3 in) of armor to the front. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  It was armed with the long barreled 8. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt 8 cm KwK. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  43 L/71 anti-tank cannon. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  The chassis was also the basis for the Jagdtiger turretless Jagdpanzer anti-tank vehicle. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt 
The Tiger II was issued to heavy tank battalions of the Army and the Waffen-SS. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  It was first used in combat by 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion during the Allied invasion of Normandy on 11 July 1944; on the Eastern Front, the first unit to be outfitted with the Tiger II was the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion, which by 1 September 1944 listed 25 Tiger IIs operational. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt 

The first combat use of the Tiger II was by the 1st Company of the 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion (s. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt H. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt Pz. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt Abt. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  503) during the Battle of Normandy, opposing Operation Atlantic between Troarn and Demouville on 18 July 1944. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  Two were lost in combat, while the company commander's tank became irrecoverably trapped after falling into a bomb crater created during Operation Goodwood. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  
On the Eastern Front, it was first used on 12 August 1944 by the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion (s. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt H. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt Pz. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt Abt. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  501) resisting the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  It attacked the Soviet bridgehead over the Vistula River near Baranów Sandomierski. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  On the road to Oględów, three Tiger IIs were destroyed in an ambush by a few T-34-85s. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  Because these German tanks suffered ammunition explosions, which caused many crew fatalities, main gun rounds were no longer allowed to be stowed within the turret, reducing capacity to 68. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  Up to fourteen Tiger IIs of the 501st were destroyed or captured in the area between 11 and 14 August to ambushes and flank attacks by both Soviet T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks, and ISU-122 assault guns in inconvenient sandy terrain. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  The capture of three operational Tiger IIs allowed the Soviets to conduct tests at Kubinka and to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt 

The 103rd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion (s. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt SS Pz. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt Abt. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  503) claimed approximately 500 kills in the period from January to April 1945 on the Eastern Front for the loss of 45 Tiger IIs (most of which were abandoned and destroyed by their own crews after mechanical breakdowns or for lack of fuel). A126 PzVI Tiger II capt 

The only working example is displayed at the Musée des Blindés, Saumur, France. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  It has the production turret and is accessible to the public. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  This tank belonged to the 1st Company, 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  It was believed to have been abandoned by its crew on 23 August 1944, due to engine problems, at Brueil-en-Vexin, near Mantes-la-Jolie. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  It was salvaged by the French Army in September 1944 and then stored in a factory in Satory before being transferred to the museum in 1975. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  Believed to have carried turret number 123, Colonel Michel Aubry, the founder of the museum, decided to put 233 on the turret in honour of the Tiger II that destroyed his Sherman tank at the end of the war. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt  Unlike other captured German vehicles, this Tiger II was never used by the French Army. A126 PzVI Tiger II capt
