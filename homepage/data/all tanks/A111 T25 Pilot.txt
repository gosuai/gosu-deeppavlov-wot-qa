{{TankData|Tank=T25PilotNumber1
|The T25 Pilot is, in its own right, a combination of both the M26 Pershing and the T20; players familiar with the playstyles of both of these tanks will feel right at home with the T25 Pilot. A111 T25 Pilot  The T25 Pilot, compared to other tier 8 premium mediums, is a very well rounded tank, it is a Jack-of-all-Trades much like the Pershing and combines a good mix of average (Or slightly above average in some aspects) mobility, armor, and firepower. A111 T25 Pilot  Whereas, for example, the CDC trades armor for exceptional mobility or the T-54 Mod. A111 T25 Pilot  1 trades mobility for armor. A111 T25 Pilot  The T25 will not last long on its own due to its poor (Though not horrible) armor, and works best in a medium tank wolf pack or as a mid-range sniper, preferably shooting over a ridge only exposing its reasonably well armored turret. A111 T25 Pilot  As for its credit making potential, its fast-firing 90mm as well as its bouncy turret should earn the player a respectable sum. A111 T25 Pilot  One last thing to note is that the T25 travels 7 km/h faster than the Pershing (55 km/h,) and this speed advantage makes the T25 much more flexible at repositioning and escaping from sticky situations.
