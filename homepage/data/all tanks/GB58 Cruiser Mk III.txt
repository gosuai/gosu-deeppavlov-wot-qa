|Bumped up to Tier 3 in 1. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 9, the Cruiser III is a departure from the first two tanks in the British Tech Tree. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  Boasting greatly improved mobility at the cost of armour, this tank excels as a flanker, and can even do well as a sniper with the decent accuracy and penetration on its QF 2-pdr.

|InTheGame_pros=
* Good power/weight ratio
* Upgraded turret provides spaced armor
* High view range
* 15 degrees of gun depression

|InTheGame_cons=
* Weak armour and below average HP
* Horrifyingly poor hull traverse at high speed
* Vulnerable to ammo rack damage from frontal shots, as ammo rack is located in the front
* Auto cannons and HE shells are very effective against this tank

Stock, this tank turns poorly at high speed, similar to the USSR A-20. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  However, once you're going in the right direction you will reach top speed rather quickly thanks to the tanks engine power. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 

Unfortunately, with the jump to Tier 3 in Update 1. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 9, the Pom-Pom is no longer a viable long-term option for this tank; its penetration is lacking when fighting against even some other Tier 3 tanks, let alone Tier 4's. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  The Cruiser III also does not get the upgraded 40 mm Bofors gun that the Cruiser IV had at Tier 3, meaning the only truly viable gun is the QF 2-pdr Mk. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  IX. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  Though the DPM and gun handling are a bit worse than they were at Tier 2, The penetration is unchanged, and the gun fits right in with those on the other Tier 3 Light Tanks. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 

While it doesn't have much in the way of armour, it has very good gun depression, allowing it to easily hull down on hilly terrain. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  The second turret also has spaced armour on the sides, which helps absorb HE damage. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 

One interesting thing to note is that every British radio, all the way up to tier 10, has the same weight. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  So, radio upgrades will never factor into any weight capacity considerations you may have when it comes to your British tanks. GB58 Cruiser Mk III

* The '''40 mm Pom-Pom''' carries over from Cruiser II and should be mounted immediately. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 
* First, research the '''Nuffield Liberty Mk. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  III''' engine for a nice boost to horsepower without any added weight. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 
* The suspension should be researched next for improved hull traverse speed. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 
* The turret gives extra health and view range at the cost of turret traverse speed. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 
* Finally, research the radios. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  The '''WS. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  No. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  19 Mk. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  I''' carries over to the Cruiser IV. GB58 Cruiser Mk III

Cruiser, Mk III also known by its General Staff specification number A13 Mark I was a British cruiser tank of the Second World War. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  It was the first British cruiser tank to use the Christie suspension system which gave higher speeds and better cross-country performance, previous models of cruiser tanks having used triple wheeled bogie suspension. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 

==Development history==

Orders for the Mk I and Mk II Cruiser tanks were restricted, since the British Army had decided to produce a more advanced and faster cruiser tank which would incorporate the Christie suspension designed by American inventor J. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  Walter Christie and have better armour. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  In 1936, General Martel, a pioneer in tank design who had published works on armoured warfare and pioneered the lightly armoured "tankette" to enhance infantry mobility, became Assistant Director of Mechanization at the War Office. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  Later that year Martel witnessed demonstrations of Soviet tank designs including the BT tank, which had been influenced by Christie's work. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  He urged the adoption of a tank that would use the suspension system and also follow Christie's practice of using a lightweight aircraft engine such as the Liberty Engine. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  The government authorized purchase and licensing of a Christie design via the Nuffield Organization rather than contact the Soviet authorities. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 

The vehicle obtained from Christie became the basis of the Cruiser Mk III (A13). GB58 Cruiser Mk III  It had to be extensively redesigned by Morris Commercial Cars as it was too small and had several faults Christie had not addressed. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  A new company Nuffield Mechanization & Aero Limited was formed for the development and production of the design. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  At a meeting of the General Staff, an official specification was determined. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  This included 30 mm (1. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 2 in) armour, a 2 pdr gun, road speed of 30 mph. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  A subsequent review of the specification by Martel and Hobart approved 30mm armour all round provided cross-country speed could be kept at 25 mph. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  Pending the delivery of the A13, an interim design was approved - of the A7, A9 and A10, the A9 was selected. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 

The first prototype (the A13-E1) was delivered in 1937. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  Following testing of the two prototypes, the A13 was ordered into production and a total of 65 were manufactured. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  The Mk III weighed 14 long tons (14,200 kg) had a crew of 4, a 340 hp engine which gave a top speed of 30 mph (48 km/h) and was armed with a 2 pounder gun and a machine gun. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  However, when it was introduced into service in 1937, the Army still lacked a formal tank division. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  Sixty five were built, the original order being for 50. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  The order was completed by mid 1939. GB58 Cruiser Mk III 

==Combat history==

Like most British cruisers, the A 13 was fast but under armoured and proved unreliable mechanically. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  Most were lost in the French campaign in 1940, but a few were used in Greece and the North African campaign in 1940-41. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  The basic design was used for the Cruiser Mk IV. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  As part of the British Expeditionary Force sent to France, the Cruiser Mark II equipped units in the 1st Armoured Division. GB58 Cruiser Mk III  In the Western Desert 1940-1941 (Libya) they were in the units of the 7th Armoured Division. GB58 Cruiser Mk III
