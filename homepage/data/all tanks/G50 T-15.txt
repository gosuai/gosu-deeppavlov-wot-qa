{{TankData|Tank=G50_T-15
|Mostly disregarded by players, this tank is one little mean monster capable of taking out any tier 1-3 tank it gets to face from almost any angle, but it struggles against tier 4. G50 T-15   It's fast, accurate, and mobile, and with an excellent view range/radio combination it can still provide valuable recon information as a passive scout. G50 T-15   Mind that in such role, crew training and a Camouflage Net is much needed, as it won't survive long against some tier 4's. G50 T-15  

|InTheGame_pros=
* Very good hit points for a tier 3 tank
* Good acceleration and traverse speed
* Good accuracy, aim time, turret traverse speed, and elevation arc
* Superb view range and signal range
* Front armor is good for a light and enough to stop autocannon rounds

|InTheGame_cons=
* The gun has below average penetration and damage even on tier 3
* Scouting can be difficult when there are many other fast tanks
* Missing Gunner crew slot for training tier VI - VIII light crews

The T 15 is a fast light tank, which plays similarly to the [[Tetrarch]]. G50 T-15   It has excellent view range and good HP, but the gun, while adequate against tier 3, starts to become useless against tier 4. G50 T-15   Aim for weak points and then move. G50 T-15   You are maneuverable so make use of it. G50 T-15   An idle T 15 is often a dead T 15. G50 T-15 

The radio range is excellent for its tier so use Coated Optics and/or a Binocular Telescope and spot in tier 4 battles -- you can earn a lot of credits. G50 T-15   If you find a good bush to spot from then take advantage of it so your arty and TD's have targets. G50 T-15   Make sure to move if you get spotted or you're not lighting anything. G50 T-15   Binoculars and a camo net are the best equipment for this. G50 T-15 

You should definitely use experienced crew (premium tanks can use any crew trained for same class) -- any German light tank crew trained to 100% will do, and train them full camouflage skills, Sixth Sense for Commander and View Range enhancing skills (Recon for Commander and Situational Awareness for Radio Operator). G50 T-15   With optics and proper skills this tank's View Range exceeds 400m, which is impressive for a tier 3 tank. G50 T-15

|History=
Designed by the company Å koda starting in 1940, it weighed between 11-13 tons and had a maximum speed of 50-60 km/h. G50 T-15   By 1942 the German government had lost interest in the development of the tank, but the company still continued development in-house. G50 T-15   Only four prototypes were made, and the T 15 never saw battle or entered active service. G50 T-15  
Note that it was supposed to be very modestly armored and armed like most light tanks, with a 50mm cannon KwK 39 L/60 gun and MG34 and 30mm armor at its weakest point. G50 T-15
