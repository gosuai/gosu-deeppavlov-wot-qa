The WZ-111G FT comes stock with the top 130mm gun of its tier VIII predecessor. Ch37 WZ111G FT  It's a capable gun even at tier IX and won't hold you back. Ch37 WZ111G FT  While aim time and dpm of the 130mm gun has been slightly improved compared to the WZ-111-1G FT it's a fairly minor change. Ch37 WZ111G FT  Mobility is also similar to the tier VIII WZ-111-1G FT and not very good, mobile opponents can easily deal with the sluggish turn rate of the WZ-111G FT and flank it. Ch37 WZ111G FT  The big difference and what makes the WZ-111G FT a more capable tank destroyer than its predecessor is the number of hit points which nearly doubles and the improved armor protection. Ch37 WZ111G FT   

Tier IX matchmaking meanwhile means the WZ-111G FT often will be mid tier and even top tier. Ch37 WZ111G FT  Consequently there may be a temptation to let more weakly armored tank destroyers do the sniping and instead use the armor and hit points of the WZ-111G FT to pressure opponents at a forward choke point. Ch37 WZ111G FT  The 152mm top gun does support such an aggressive play style well with its massive alpha damage which allows for the favorable trading of shots. Ch37 WZ111G FT  Should you favor this approach, do consider the repair skill for your crew as getting tracked is more problematic with opponents close enough to flank you. Ch37 WZ111G FT 

Do realize however that poor accuracy and low shell velocity means the 152mm top gun may not necessarily be the best gun for long range sniping. Ch37 WZ111G FT  While it offers impressive penetration and won't struggle with large and heavily armored targets, small and/or mobile opponents certainly will prove difficult to hit.
