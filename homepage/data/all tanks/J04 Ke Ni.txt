|History= The Type 98 developed in 1938 was a light tank with the same weight as the earlier Type 95, but with thicker armor. J04 Ke Ni  The prototype of the new Type 98 tank was completed by Hino Motors in 1939, but it did not enter production at the time. J04 Ke Ni  This can be attributed to the adequate performance of the aging Type 95 against obsolete tanks of National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China forces. J04 Ke Ni 


With the start of World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff quickly realized that the Type 95 design was vulnerable to . J04 Ke Ni 50 caliber machine gun fire and attempted to develop a light tank with the same weight as the Type 95, but with thicker armor. J04 Ke Ni  A production contract for the Type 98 was awarded to Hino Motors and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, with a total of 104 Type 98s are known to have been built, 1 in 1941, 24 in 1942 and 79 in 1943. J04 Ke Ni  By the end of the war, the Imperial Navy had priority on steel for warships and aircraft construction, leaving the Imperial Japanese Army at the bottom of the list for raw material to build tanks with. J04 Ke Ni 

The design of the Type 98, in comparison to the Type 95, featured thicker, welded armor of improved shape, including the use of a Mitsubishi Type 100 6-Cylinder air-cooled diesel engine, rated at 130 horsepower, and located sideways to make maintenance easier. J04 Ke Ni  Slightly lighter and shorter than the original Type 95, it could travel at 50 km/h even with its thicker armor. J04 Ke Ni  Three pairs of bogies with six road-wheels connected to the chassis using bell cranks, which transferred any movement in the bogies into sideways motion that was absorbed by springs. J04 Ke Ni 

In contrast to the one-man turret of Type 95, the Type 98 had a conventional two-man turret, carrying a Type 100 37 mm tank gun, with a muzzle velocity of 760 m/s, and also a coaxial 7. J04 Ke Ni 7 mm machine gun. J04 Ke Ni 

Variants:



Type 98B Ke-Ni Otsu

Outside the standard Type 98, also known as the Type 98A Ke-Ni Ko, there was the experimental Type 98B Ke-Ni Otsu developed by Hino Motors from the Prototype 98B. J04 Ke Ni  It featured four large road wheels and no return rollers, in a Christie-like fashion. J04 Ke Ni  This version was never accepted into production. J04 Ke Ni 

Type 98 Ta-Se SPAA

The Type 98 Ta-Se 20 mm (0. J04 Ke Ni 79 in) anti-aircraft prototype was developed in November 1941, with a Soki Type 2 20 mm (0. J04 Ke Ni 79 in) AA gun derived from the Type 98 auto-cannon, and housed in a large open turret. J04 Ke Ni  “Ta” stands for “Taikū” (“anti-air”) and “Se” for sensha (“tank”). J04 Ke Ni  After deceiving trials, the project was cancelled in 1943. J04 Ke Ni 

Type 2 Ke-To

This model was the main derivative of the Type 98. J04 Ke Ni  It was all-improved, with a better Type 1 37 mm (1. J04 Ke Ni 46 in) main gun, capable of a muzzle velocity of 810 m/s in a modified, roomier turret. J04 Ke Ni  The “Ke” stands for “light” and “To”, the seventh. J04 Ke Ni  Only 28 were built in all, during the fall of 1944 and 1945. J04 Ke Ni  Like most Japanese tanks this late in the war, it never left the Home Islands and never fought. J04 Ke Ni 

Wartime actions:

The 104 (132 according to another source) Type 98 Ke-Nis were produced by Hino Motors (Hino Jidosha Kogyo) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. J04 Ke Ni  These small numbers can be explained by the priority given to the building of warships. J04 Ke Ni  According to General Hara, this small production was also explained by the reluctance of the Army High Command to increase the number of different types in service, and because crews were already well trained and quite happy with the existing Ha-Go type. J04 Ke Ni  Being released so late in the war, the Ke-Ni operational records are unknown and most likely they were given to young recruits and kept in the Home Islands. J04 Ke Ni
