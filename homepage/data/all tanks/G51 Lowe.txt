{{TankData|Tank=Lowe
|Designed for sniping, the Löwe is armed with the very accurate 10. G51 Lowe 5 cm KwK L/70, and is paired with a rather decent hull. G51 Lowe  The turret however is heavily sloped allowing it to bounce even high tier guns . G51 Lowe  The performance of this tank is quite good for its tier, provided that it does not engage in close quarter combat, which is almost certain death for this tank. G51 Lowe  It has poor acceleration, so any reversal in direction will take some time. G51 Lowe  As a premium tank, it produces a significantly higher credit income than a typical tier 8 tank. G51 Lowe  The Löwe was added in the 0. G51 Lowe 6. G51 Lowe 4. G51 Lowe  patch, along with the [[KV-5]] heavy tank. G51 Lowe

One of the oldest and most well-known premium tanks in World of Tanks, the Löwe is a strong support tank thanks to its accurate 10,5cm cannon and good (though not amazing) armor profile. G51 Lowe  Lacking DPM and being a very large and cumbersome target, it is unsuited for brawling as it lacks the reload speed and mobility to keep up with faster, harder-hitting heavy tanks such as the Soviets and Chinese, and is more at home supporting a push or finding a good hull-down position and providing long range fire. G51 Lowe  Top tier it is an imposing foe however, and should be at the front fighting with other heavy tanks (careful not to overcommit and become isolated though). G51 Lowe 

The Löwe excels at sidescraping. G51 Lowe  Thanks to its very strong turret armor and thick side armor, it can be a troublesome opponent and difficult to dislodge if it can cover its lower frontal plate (a well-known weakspot) and possibly the upper glacis when facing higher tiers as well, which, while respectably thick and sloped, cannot be relied upon against tanks with very high penetration or premium ammunition (unless heavy angling further improves its effective thickness or, better yet, produces autobounces). G51 Lowe  Beware of artillery though, as the Löwe is a very large vehicle and difficult to fully hide behind cover, and severely lacking in concealment. G51 Lowe  

Previously maligned due to its lackluster stats, the Löwe received a few rounds of buffs that made it the more competitive tank that it is today, and it still is one of the better credit earners in the game. G51 Lowe  A good match in the Löwe will usually net respectable amounts of credits. G51 Lowe

|History=
The development of super heavy tank started as early as 1941, when Krupp started the studies of super-heavy Soviet tanks. G51 Lowe  In November of 1941, it was specified that the new heavy tank was to have 140mm front and 100mm thick side armor. G51 Lowe  The vehicle was to be operated by 5 men crew - 3 in the turret and 2 in the hull. G51 Lowe  This new panzer was to have maximum speed of some 44km/h being powered by 1000hp Daimler-Benz marine engine used in Schnellboot (torpedo boat). G51 Lowe  The main armament was to be mounted in the turret. G51 Lowe  The weight was to be up to 90 tons. G51 Lowe 

In the early months of 1942, Krupp was ordered to start the process of designing new heavy tank designated PzKpfw VII Lowe (VK7201). G51 Lowe  Its design was based on previous project by Krupp designated VK7001 (Tiger-Maus) and created in competition with Porsche's designs (including first Maus designs). G51 Lowe  VK7001 was to be armed with either 150mm Kanone L/37 (or L/40) or 105mm KwK L/70 gun. G51 Lowe  Löwe was to utilize Tiger II's components in order to simplify the production and service. G51 Lowe 

Designers planned to build two variants of this streamlined vehicle with rear mounted turret. G51 Lowe  Light (leichte) variant would have frontal armor protection of 100mm and it would weight 76 tons. G51 Lowe  Heavy (schwere) variant would have frontal armor protection of 120mm and it would weight 90 tons. G51 Lowe  Both variants would be armed with 105mm L/70 gun and coaxial machine gun. G51 Lowe  It is known that 90ton schwere Lowe was to have its turret mounted centrally and in overall design resembled future Tiger II. G51 Lowe  Variants of Lowe were both to be operated by the crew of five. G51 Lowe  It was calculated that their maximum speed would range from 23km/h (schwere) to 27km/h (leichte). G51 Lowe  Adolf Hitler ordered that the design Leichte Lowe was to be dropped in favour of Schwere Lowe. G51 Lowe  Lion was to be redesigned in order to carry 150mm L/40 or 150mm L/37 (probably 150mm KwK 44 L/38) gun and its frontal armor protection was to be changed to 140mm. G51 Lowe  In order to improve its performance, 900-1000mm wide tracks were to be used and top speed was to be increased to 30km/h. G51 Lowe 
In late 1942, this project was cancelled in favour of the development of the Maus. G51 Lowe  During the development of Tiger II, designers planned to build redesigned version of Lowe (as suggested by Oberst Fichtner), which would be armed with 88mm KwK L/71 gun and its frontal armor protection would be 140mm (as planned before). G51 Lowe  Redesigned Lowe would be able to travel at maximum speed of 35km/h and it would weight 90 tons. G51 Lowe  It was to be powered by Maybach HL 230 P 30, 12-cylinder engine producing 800hp. G51 Lowe  Lowe would be 7. G51 Lowe 74 meters long (with the gun), 3. G51 Lowe 83 meters wide and 3. G51 Lowe 08 meters high. G51 Lowe  Lowe would be operated by the crew of five. G51 Lowe  It was planned that Lowe would eventually replace Tiger II. G51 Lowe 

From February to May of 1942, six different designs were considered, all based on the requirements for Lowe. G51 Lowe  On March 5/6th of 1942, order for heavier tank was placed and project Lowe was stopped in July of 1942. G51 Lowe  Lowe project never reached the prototype stage but it paved the way for its successor's development - Porsche's Maus. G51 Lowe
