|The Comet is a tank well suited for flanking, as its armor is neither good nor bad for its class; it won't survive brawls for long periods of time. GB22 Comet  It sports a couple of advantages over the Cromwell, such as a gun mantlet and lowered profile on the upgraded turret. GB22 Comet  However, it gets an "almost" inadequate top gun, barely an upgrade over the 75mm HV. GB22 Comet  What is more, in the footsteps of its predecessor, its handling and speed are somewhat slower, being barely better than those of the [[Pz. GB22 Comet Kpfw. GB22 Comet  V Panther|Panther]] and not quite as good as those of the [[T20]]. GB22 Comet  Clever use of flanking tactics and gun depression are necessary to successfully play this tank. GB22 Comet

The Comet has a nearly similar playing technique to the Cromwell, although it is not as nimble. GB22 Comet  It is a mobile medium tank with nearly decent traverse and a good ratio of horsepower per Ton which allow you to reach high speeds to assist allies. GB22 Comet  With the new turret with better view range, excellent gun depression, and ability to mount a vertical stabilizer the Comet takes and adapts the good features from the M4A3E8 and the Cromwell into a single tank. GB22 Comet  However, the gun itself is mediocre for its tier; with only 148mm of penetration, it is outclassed by most other mediums. GB22 Comet  The OQF 77mm should be used in flanking manoeuvres against heavily armored opponents. GB22 Comet  This is where the Comet's manoeuvrability, size and speed come in, allowing it to get to enemy flanks easily. GB22 Comet  Once in position, its DPM will tear through all but the most durable targets. GB22 Comet  

Stock, the Comet starts off better than the other Tier 7 mediums, and your upgraded turret allows you to use gun depression tactics with impunity, much like the better American tanks, thanks to your gun mantlet and low profile. GB22 Comet  It doesn't get much in the way of upgrades though, and ends up significantly weaker in armament for its tier than e. GB22 Comet g. GB22 Comet  the Panther. GB22 Comet  Still, it is maneuverable, and appears to have fairly good camouflage characteristics. GB22 Comet  This tank also excels at supporting heavy tanks with its rate of fire. GB22 Comet  Use this to your advantage at all times. GB22 Comet 

If you can manage to succeed in - and indeed, actually ''like'' - the Comet, the upcoming Centurion tank will feel like a whole different world. GB22 Comet  That world won't be a bad one, mind you - Very much the opposite! It will be a world where you not only dominate hills, but are able to shoot and penetrate most tanks you face from across the map. GB22 Comet

* The engine, second radio and the 75 mm Vickers HV carries from the [[Cromwell]] should be mounted immediately. GB22 Comet  The top radio and the top gun QQF 77 mm MK. GB22 Comet II can be carried from the heavy tank line. GB22 Comet 
* The second research should be the suspension, the tank is too heavy for any upgrade. GB22 Comet 
* Then research the second turret and the QQF 77 mm gun. GB22 Comet 
* Last should be the top radio. GB22 Comet

[[image:GB-Cruiser-CometPrototype. GB22 Comet jpg|thumb|200px|left|Comet Prototype]]
Combat experience against the Germans in the Western Desert Campaign demonstrated to the British many shortcomings with their cruiser tanks. GB22 Comet  Hence a request was made in 1941 to the Nuffield Organisation and Leyland Motors Ltd for a new heavy cruiser tank that could achieve battle superiority over German models. GB22 Comet  For reasons of economy and efficiency, it had to use as many components as possible from the current A15 Cruiser tank Mk VI Crusader tank. GB22 Comet 

The initial designs submitted were the A24 Cruiser Tank Mk VII Cavalier tank from Nuffield powered by a Nuffield-Liberty L-12 engine and the A27L Cruiser tank Mk VII Centaur tank from Leyland, which was also powered by the Liberty L-12 but would be able to use the more powerful Rolls-Royce Meteor when it became available. GB22 Comet 

The Cruiser tank Mk VII A27M Cromwell was the third parallel development to the Cavalier and Centaur. GB22 Comet  The Cromwell's Meteor engine proved to be very reliable and gave the Cromwell good mobility, but some problems did appear. GB22 Comet  The tank was prone to throwing its tracks if track tension was not maintained properly or if it turned at too high a speed or too sharply. GB22 Comet  There were also some problems with suspension breakage, partly due to the Cromwell's high speed. GB22 Comet 

A 17 pounder version of the Cromwell, the A30 Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tank, was under development. GB22 Comet  To handle the large gun, the Cromwell hull had to be lengthened and a large turret set on top. GB22 Comet  Due to the slow production of Challengers, the Sherman Firefly (a Sherman tank fitted with the 17 pounder gun) conversion received official support. GB22 Comet  Until the Challenger was available, one Firefly would be issued to each Cromwell troop (giving three Cromwells and one Sherman Firefly); but this was unsatisfactory due to the different maintenance requirements and associated supply complication of two tank models, as well as the performance difference between Cromwell and Sherman. GB22 Comet 


'''A34'''

With the A34 (the General Staff specification), later named Comet, the tank designers opted to correct some of the Cromwell's flaws (the track shedding and broken suspension problems) and enhance the Cromwell's main strengths, low height and high speed. GB22 Comet  Originally, it had been expected that the tank would use a new gun from Vickers: the "High Velocity 75mm". GB22 Comet  However, as designed, the gun would not fit into the turret size available. GB22 Comet  So the gun was changed to a different gun, the "77mm HV". GB22 Comet  This gun used the same calibre (76. GB22 Comet 2 mm) projectile as the 17-pounder but the shell casing was from the older QF 3 inch 20 cwt gun loaded to higher pressures. GB22 Comet  The resulting round was completely different to 17-pounder ammunition. GB22 Comet  It had a lower muzzle velocity than the 17-pounder but the ammunition was much more compact and more easily stored and handled within the tank. GB22 Comet  This made it possible to mount the gun on a smaller turret ring - the Challenger turret had been so large to allow space for two loaders - without making the hull wider. GB22 Comet  Several other improvements were made: armour protection was increased, the hull and turret were welded[2] with a cast gun mantlet, ammunition was stored in armoured bins, the suspension was strengthened, return rollers were added and the turret was electrically traversed (a design feature taken from the Churchill tank), with a generator powered by the main engine rather than the hydraulic system of the Cromwell. GB22 Comet 

Armour on the Comet ranged from 32 mm to 74 mm on the hull, while the turret was from 57 to 102 mm. GB22 Comet  The Comet tank's top speed was limited from the Cromwell's 40+ mph to a slower, but respectable 32 mph (51 km/h) to preserve suspension and engine components and to reduce track wear. GB22 Comet  The mild steel prototype was ready in February 1944 and entered trials. GB22 Comet  Although concerns about the hull gunner and belly armour were put to one side (to avoid redesign), there was still sufficient delay caused by minor modifications and changes that production models did not begin to be delivered until September 1944. GB22 Comet  Intended to be in service by December 1944, crew training was delayed by the German Ardennes Offensive. GB22 Comet  By the end of the war, 1,200 had been produced. GB22 Comet  Comet was fitted with two radio sets: a No. GB22 Comet  19 Wireless, for communication with the regiment and the troop, and a No. GB22 Comet  38 Wireless for communication with infantry units. GB22 Comet  Like many British tanks, it also had a telephone handset mounted on the rear so that accompanying infantry could talk to the crew. GB22 Comet

Every armament configuration besides the 77 mm HV gun is fictitious. GB22 Comet 
* The Cromwell Mk. GB22 Comet  IV turret was only fitted to the Cromwell and experimented on a [[Matilda Black Prince|Matilda]]. GB22 Comet  Its configuration on the Comet is fake. GB22 Comet 
* The Rolls-Royce Meteor Mk. GB22 Comet  IVB engine was only fitted to the Centurion tank. GB22 Comet  Its configuration on the Comet is also fake. GB22 Comet 
* SCC No. GB22 Comet  15 Olive Drab paint scheme is missing. GB22 Comet  This was the base colour on all British AFVs in Europe from April 1944. GB22 Comet 
* The Royal Armoured Corps recognition mark (or flash) was only used until mid-1942; the Comet entered service in December 1944. GB22 Comet
