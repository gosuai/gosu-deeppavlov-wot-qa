[[File:AnnoGB70 FV4202 105. FV4202 105 png|left]] The '''FV4202 105''' was a [[UK|British]] tier 10 [[medium Tanks|medium tank]]. FV4202 105 

Something of a departure from the philosophies of more or less all British mediums before it, the FV4202 may seem at first to be simply an upgrade of the [[Centurion Mk. FV4202 105  7/1]] - and may indeed be played as such - but is in fact quite its own beast. FV4202 105  Its significantly smaller profile, extremely well-sloped frontal armor and increased agility means that this tank can stand to take on a much more frontal role than its predecessor, and contributes to make it a much more well-rounded vehicle. FV4202 105  In fact, the only things that truly stand out about the FV4202 are its good cannon and turret, and slow top speed; in all other regards it behaves very much like a "Jack of all trades, master of none" sort of tank when compared to its classmates. FV4202 105 

The FV4202 has been removed from its tier X medium location as of patch 9. FV4202 105 12 to become a tier VIII premium tank in a future patch, while its tier X medium role has been filled by the [[Centurion Action X]]. FV4202 105

|pros=
* Very good responsiveness and mobility
* HESH shells allow for inordinate damage over time against soft-shelled targets
* Excellent gun depression and gun handling with and balanced gun characteristics
* Surprisingly strong upper front plate due to sloping

|cons=
* Limited top speed
* No effective armor other than upper front plate
* No gun mantlet leading to an overall less reliable turret, unlike its predecessors

|performance=
The FV4202, by dint of being so well-rounded, fills some sort of imaginary hole between nearly all other Tier X medium tanks. FV4202 105  By now, having played the Centurions, one will be used to the role of support tank, and thanks to its quite accurate gun and higher DPM than the [[E-50 Ausf. FV4202 105  M]] the Brit can fill this role neatly. FV4202 105  However, limiting oneself to that alone is sort of undeserving of this tank's potential, as it has superior gun depression and respectable camouflage. FV4202 105  Its agility also means that it can fight in between buildings and wolf pack quite effectively, which all adds up to making it a quite potent flanker, best employed as a long-range harasser and sharpshooter from the sides of the enemy front.

* None, as all modules are already researched upon acquiring the tank
