|InTheGame_pros= 
* Immense Gun traverse range
* Magnificent gun range, can shoot from corner to corner, comparable to tier 4 SPG's
* Has only one gun, so no stock grind. A107 T1 HMC 
* Second highest Hitpoints of the Tier 2 SPG's by barely anything, and is second to the [[Tank:G93_GW_Mk_VIe|G. A107 T1 HMC Pz. A107 T1 HMC Mk. A107 T1 HMC VI. A107 T1 HMC ]]
* Hull traverse is second best, and sets the tone for the rest of the American SPG line, slow but decent. A107 T1 HMC 

|InTheGame_cons= 
* Only one gun, it doesn't get any better than what you start with. A107 T1 HMC 
* Ridiculously bad fully-aimed accuracy, coupled with large recticle bloom and slow aim time, second worst for the tier 2 SPG's. A107 T1 HMC  Expect to miss plenty of shots. A107 T1 HMC 

* Large profile makes it easy to hit. A107 T1 HMC 
* Second worst top radio range
* Tied for second lowest rate of fire
* Lowest penetration out of all the Tier 2 SPG's, lower than the British [[Tank:GB25_Loyd_Gun_Carriage|Loyd GC]]

Overall, the T1 HMC is best described as second to something. A107 T1 HMC  It is second to nearly everything, be it second best or second worst. A107 T1 HMC  In Fact, it's only the best in gun range and gun arc ( How far it can shoot and how far it can traverse before having to move the hull). A107 T1 HMC  The gun range is extremely far, despite mostly seeing maps where this won't be quite needed. A107 T1 HMC  The gun traverse range is very impressive, meaning very little hull traverse will be needed. A107 T1 HMC  That's quite important as the gun's accuracy is very bad. A107 T1 HMC  You will miss quite a lot of shots, thanks to the aforementioned accuracy coupled with a slow aim time and big recticle bloom. A107 T1 HMC  Also, self-defense will be difficult. A107 T1 HMC  The large profile won't hide you very much, your low hp doesn't help, and the reload will be the cherry on the dead tank sundae. A107 T1 HMC  There is little that the T1 HMC has that makes it better than any other SPG, other than gun range and gun arc. A107 T1 HMC  Even if you can shoot far, you most likely won't hit anything reliably. A107 T1 HMC  You don't have the fast aim speed of the [[FT BS]] or [[Tank:R16_SU-18|SU-18]], nor the high damage the [[Tank:G93_GW_Mk_VIe|G. A107 T1 HMC Pz. A107 T1 HMC Mk. A107 T1 HMC VI]] has if it were to hit. A107 T1 HMC  The T1 HMC is best described as an under-powered SPG. A107 T1 HMC
