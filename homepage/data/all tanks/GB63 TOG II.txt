|Very large and slow, the TOG II is one of the most popular and easily recognizable vehicles in World of Tanks. GB63 TOG II   Despite its bulky appearance, it's not an unstoppable behemoth and instead derives its strength from its ''1,560 hit points'' and fantastic gun. GB63 TOG II   The huge hit point pool and powerful, fast firing 17-pounder gun make it ideal as a base defense tank. GB63 TOG II  With proper positioning and hit point rationing, it can swing seemingly hopeless situations in its favor and win battles for its teams. GB63 TOG II

The TOG II is a heavy tank that plays like no other heavy at any tier. GB63 TOG II  It has a 14 km/h top speed which is slow even for a heavy (the slowest in the game). GB63 TOG II  With only 76 mm of armor, it's a heavy tank in name only. GB63 TOG II  It is one of the longest tanks in the game, so long that it can even be used to block off roads and bridges in desperate situations. GB63 TOG II  In place of strong armor, instead it gets an incredible amount of hit points. GB63 TOG II  With 1,560 hit points, it has more than any tier VI tank. GB63 TOG II  It is also capable of hitting back with a powerful 17-pounder gun. GB63 TOG II  This fast firing and accurate gun can quickly evaporate enemy tank's health pools at any range and is more than capable of perma-tracking enemies. GB63 TOG II  

Incapable of brawling in the same sense as other heavy tanks are, it can not lead or take part in an advance due to its slow speed. GB63 TOG II  Instead, it typically engages targets by trading hit points with them. GB63 TOG II  This is best done against targets who are already weakened, and thus properly positioned, is a very formidable late game tank after both teams have lost most of their hit points. GB63 TOG II  Its huge hit point pool and fast firing gun enable it to take on multiple lower health targets simultaneously and win. GB63 TOG II  In this way it can completely turn a bad game around for its team. GB63 TOG II  Due to its slow speed, armor that is more that of a medium tank, but excellent gun and massive hit points, the TOG II by default is ''not'' an attacking tank but more of a base defense tank, at which it greatly excels. GB63 TOG II   Any enemy tanks that break through the front lines and approach the base circle area are usually damaged and have their hit points whittled down, when suddenly they are confronted with a TOG II with its full 1,560 hit points and fast firing, incinerating gun!  The end for the approaching enemy tanks is almost always certain and this is where the TOG II really shines. GB63 TOG II  

The TOG II also rakes in huge quantities of silver coins and XP. GB63 TOG II   It's not a race car, but all in all, played properly, the TOG II has a lot going for it. GB63 TOG II  It also has the benefit of Preferred Matchmaking, which means it will never be matched against anything higher than tier VII opponents. GB63 TOG II

[[image:TOG II 2. GB63 TOG II jpg|thumb|200px|left|The early version of the TOG II mounting a 77 mm cannon]]
This enormous tank was designed on the premise that World War II would evolve in the same way as the First World War. GB63 TOG II  Some believed that existing tanks would not be able to deal with such conditions, and one of the most influential was Sir Albert Stern, who had been secretary to the Landships Committee in the First World War. GB63 TOG II  In company with many others involved in tank design in 1916, including Sir William Tritton, Sir Eustace Tennyson D'Eyncourt, Sir Ernest Swinton and Walter Wilson, Stern was authorised by the War Office to design a heavy tank on First World War principles.

==Development history==

At the beginning of World War II (September 1939) some military officers and engineers thought that the new war would evolve in the same way as the First World War. GB63 TOG II  The war would be static, with the opposing armies occupying two lines of trenches running from the North Sea coast to the Swiss border, separated by a ‘no mans land’ swept by artillery and machine gun fire. GB63 TOG II  Sir Albert Stern, Secretary of the Landships Committee during the First World War, believed that the sort of tanks being produced in 1939 would not be able to cope with these conditions. GB63 TOG II  In company with other engineers involved in tank design in 1916, including Sir Eustace Tennyson D’Eyncourt (Former Director of Naval Construction), Sir Ernest Swinton and Walter Wilson, Stern was asked by the War Office to design a heavy tank using World War One principles. GB63 TOG II  The group was called officially called ‘The Special Vehicle Development Committee of the Ministry of Supply’; unofficially it was known as the TOG committee (TOG: The Old Gang). GB63 TOG II  It began work in September 1939. GB63 TOG II 

The first design resembled an enlarged World War I tank with a Matilda II turret on top and a French 75mm gun mounted in the front plate of the hull. GB63 TOG II  Fosters of Lincoln built a single prototype and trials started in October 1940. GB63 TOG II  It was powered by a Paxman-Ricardo diesel engine and had an electric final drive. GB63 TOG II  The electric drive burnt out and was replaced by a hydraulic drive; this also failed and the vehicle was scrapped. GB63 TOG II  In the meantime the committee was designing a larger vehicle of great size, the TOG II. GB63 TOG II  Its most original feature was the diesel electric transmission where the V12 diesel engine drove two electric generators, which powered two electric motors, which drove the tracks. GB63 TOG II  There was no gearbox or mechanical transmission. GB63 TOG II  (Ferdinand Porsche installed a similar system in one of his unsuccessful prototypes built for the German Army. GB63 TOG II ) The tracks, after passing around the front mounted idler dropped down below floor level to create more internal space, an idea thought to be unique to this tank. GB63 TOG II 

Fosters completed the single TOG II prototype in March 1941. GB63 TOG II  It was so heavy that it was only possible to weigh half the vehicle at a time. GB63 TOG II  The design specified machine gun sponsons on each side where the side doors are, like a British World War I tank. GB63 TOG II  These were quickly abandoned. GB63 TOG II  The tank was fitted with four different gun turrets between 1941 and 1944, ending up with the type of turret designed by Stoddart and Pitt for the A30 Challenger Heavy Cruiser Tank. GB63 TOG II  This mounted a 17pdr gun, making the tank a TOG II*. GB63 TOG II  The TOG II’s great length made it very difficult to steer and combined with its weight and low power weight ratio (7. GB63 TOG II 5hp/ton) made the tank cumbersome and unwieldy. GB63 TOG II In reality ‘The Old Gang’s’ ideas were wrong; tanks needed to be smaller, agile and more mobile. GB63 TOG II  The TOG II was finally abandoned in 1944, although the A22 Churchill had been adopted as Britain’s standard heavy infantry tank long before. GB63 TOG II
