* Outstanding DPM, penetration and shell velocity, and good accuracy
* Oddly shaped turret can be surprisingly bouncy

|InTheGame_cons= 

* Low alpha damage 
* The turret is rear-mounted, with a limited traverse arc

This tank is all about the gun - it is hands down one of the best medium guns in the game, with the only lacking stat being alpha damage. R144 K 91  It possesses the highest standard penetration of any Tier X medium (capable of reliably penetrating Maus cheeks or Type 5 cupola) along with simply absurd DPM, accuracy and aim time. R144 K 91  The K-91 is hilariously effective when played at range, having amazing camo values and a fantastic sniping gun, you can easily whittle health of enemies down without them even knowing where you are, in a similar manner to a high tier Swedish TD. R144 K 91 

However, the tank is let down by the platform the gun sits on. R144 K 91  The armour is not on the same level as the other Soviet Tier X meds, with a bulge in the turret that is easy to penetrate and a poorly armoured hull - most tanks that shoot you will penetrate you unless your oddly shaped turret pull off some miracle ricochets. R144 K 91  Furthermore, the tank cannot turn its turret a full 360 degrees, which makes it very risky to brawl with. R144 K 91  This tank is often compared to the Leopard 1 due to the similarities in play styles, with the K-91 being better for sniping and raw damage output, and the Leopard 1 having the higher alpha, peek-a-boo capability and flexibility due to the fully traversable turret. R144 K 91 

Stay back, use your speed to take advantageous positions, and abuse the camouflage and sublime gun and the K-91 is a serious force to be reckoned with. R144 K 91
