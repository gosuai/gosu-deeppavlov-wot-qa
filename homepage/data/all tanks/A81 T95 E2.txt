|InTheGame_pros=
* Good gun handling and decent accuracy
* Good gun depression
* Well rounded turret front with a good mantlet
* Large healthpool for a medium tank
* Good viewrange

|InTheGame_cons=
* Low AP (standard) penetration
* Very large turret cupola, a prominent weakspot  
* Fairly sluggish acceleration, average hp/t 
* No premium earning multipliers, earns as much as a regular Tier 8 medium tank
* Limited usefulness as a crew trainer (crew of 4 without a dedicated Radioman)


|InTheGame_performance=
This tank plays (and also looks) very much like the [[Tank:A84_M48A1|M48A1 Patton]], the main difference being a low penetration value for its tier. A81 T95 E2  Does not get a premium tank credit coefficient, which often leads to little or no money gained. A81 T95 E2  It's not a good crew trainer as it lacks a radio operator (only matches [[T54E1]], [[M48A1 Patton]], [[T69]] or [[Tank:A24_T2_med|T2 Medium Tank]])

The T95E2 is armed with the same 90 mm M41 rifled gun as the [[59-Patton]], yet the penetration value of the AP shell is inconsistent. A81 T95 E2
