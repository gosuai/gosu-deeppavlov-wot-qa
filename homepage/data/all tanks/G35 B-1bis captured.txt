{{TankData|Tank=B-1bis_captured
|While classified as a heavy tank, its maneuverability rivals that of [[Medium Tanks|medium tanks]] in its own tier, but finds itself hampered by a low top speed. G35 B-1bis captured  Its armor is more than enough for its tier. G35 B-1bis captured  Its fast reloading gun has little problem destroying most tanks in its tier, but will struggle when facing better armored foes. G35 B-1bis captured 

This tank was removed from the in-game store in February 2012, following the introduction of the French Tech Tree. G35 B-1bis captured  Sometimes it appears in the gift shop as part of special packages. G35 B-1bis captured 

|InTheGame_pros=
* High rate of fire,very short aim time and good gun depression
* 112 rounds of ammunition, which is enough for every situation. G35 B-1bis captured 
* Only sees tier 4 battles, unlike the regular [[B1]]
* Thick hull sides bounce most weapons of their tier when angled and high hit points
* Very good track traverse speed and adequate acceleration

|InTheGame_cons=
* Gun lacks penetration with standard rounds
* Enormous side profile attracts artillery/TD fire
* Frontal armor retains the 45mm weak spot
* Thin turret is easily penetrated up close, and turret hits can knock out the commander, who is also loader and gunner
* Exposed tracks which don't absorb many shots
* Low top speed
* Lackluster crew trainer/credit printer due to missing gunner and loader crew positions
* Vulnerable to howitzers
* Very weak against [[Matilda]] at any distance, as even APCR ammo can suffer from its front and side armor
* Non-standard crew, makes for awkward crew training

The low penetration of the standard rounds means you will use premium rounds often, if not always. G35 B-1bis captured  But as long as you hit and penetrate, you will still make a low profit, at least with a premium account. G35 B-1bis captured  Don’t shoot Matildas at long ranges, or Hetzers from the front, as you will mostly bounce. G35 B-1bis captured  Both are a big threat to you, as they can penetrate you. G35 B-1bis captured  Also the M3 Lee and the T-28 will penetrate you, but you can penetrate them. G35 B-1bis captured  All tank destroyers can pen you. G35 B-1bis captured  Beware of the Luchs, as it has ultra high penetration with the 3cm. G35 B-1bis captured 
A good way to avoid damage is to angle 45°, and drive forward and backwards. G35 B-1bis captured  That makes aiming for your turret and frontal weakspot very hard, but your very short aim time and the small aiming circle allows you to constantly hit the enemy. G35 B-1bis captured 

As you have two radio operators, you can go for Relaying and Signal Boosting, which may help your team since radios at tier III and IV are frequently too weak to reach across some maps without assistance. G35 B-1bis captured  Also, when you use optics and max your crew in viewrange, you will have 382m viewrange, which you can boost further with ventilation and brothers in arms. G35 B-1bis captured  Your team benefits from you much. G35 B-1bis captured  The downside is that this tank makes a poor crew trainer for other heavy tanks. G35 B-1bis captured  It is missing both gunner and loader crew slots, and the double radio operators are not required on any other German heavy tank. G35 B-1bis captured  

As your aimtime is very short, you may not want to install the gun laying drive. G35 B-1bis captured  Instead a heavy spall liner will greatly increase your survivability, while a toolbox will help with the frequent broken tracks you encounter, and improved ventilation will further boost your tanks overall stats. G35 B-1bis captured 

Again a reminder: Since the B2 has special matchmaking, you may only platoon with other B2s, or the Valentine II. G35 B-1bis captured  All other tier 4s may bring you at least into tier 5 battles. G35 B-1bis captured 

Overall this is a highly fun tank to play as you will always be top tier and thus in a good position to influence the match and obtain victory. G35 B-1bis captured  At Tier IV the concept of aiming at weakspots (or even the existence of those) is not that widespread, so your armor can actually hold up for quite a bit. G35 B-1bis captured  It is highly suited for seal clubbing and if you don't go full redneck on APCR and actually use AP versus weakly armored targets you can easily still earn a profit unlike with the Pz.

|History=
German armored forces in World War II continually suffered from numerical inferiority, leading them to make frequent use of captured Allied tanks. G35 B-1bis captured  After France's surrender in June of 1940, 160 B1 and B1 bis main battle tanks were used by the Germans as the B2 740 (f). G35 B-1bis captured  The B1 bis was an improved version of the B1 tank, featuring a 75mm howitzer mounted on the right hull front as well as a fully traversing one-man turret with a 47mm gun. G35 B-1bis captured  Front and side armor reached 60mm thickness, making the B1 bis one of the most heavily armed and armored tanks of its time. G35 B-1bis captured  Of the models that fell into German hands, about half were modified into flame tanks or self-propelled guns, with the remainder re-deployed as normal tanks. G35 B-1bis captured  These too underwent some revision, as their wireless radios were replaced with the German model. G35 B-1bis captured  A number of tanks also had an access hatch added to the turret top, and a concrete block added to the right hull front to prevent shot ricochet. G35 B-1bis captured  Other differences to the French Army version included a jack and hoist arm carried outside the tank, with additional German equipment mounted on fenders. G35 B-1bis captured

With the outbreak of war with the Soviet Union in June of 1941, the B1 bis served in a command and fire support role for flame tanks, helping to crush Russian defenses. G35 B-1bis captured  Units equipped with B1 bis tanks were also stationed on the British Channel Islands as part of the occupying army. G35 B-1bis captured  Finally, and most significantly, Free French Forces recaptured a number of B1 bis tanks towards the end of the war, and used them to great success in mopping up the remaining German forces.

Engine is considerably more powerful than it is in real life, with 340 hp compared to the historical 307. G35 B-1bis captured 
* Has the same engine as the [[B1]] and [[105 leFH18B2]], the latter which is also a B2 converted into an SPG, yet the horsepower and weight values are inconsistent. G35 B-1bis captured
