|Special [[Premium Tanks|premium]] version of the standard [[M4A3E8_Sherman|M4A3E8 Sherman]]. A104 M4A3E8A 

Nicknamed as the "Easy-Eight" or "E8", this tank is a quicker, slightly better armored version of the [[M4 Sherman]]. A104 M4A3E8A  It also has an upgraded 76mm gun with an improved rate or fire and better accuracy. A104 M4A3E8A  Despite the increased armor compared to the M4 Sherman however, the E8 is still a very soft target and will be easily destroyed if it stays exposed to enemy fire. A104 M4A3E8A  

Finding a balance is a necessity and is excellent practice for the American mediums that are to follow, which all share a similar lack of armor. A104 M4A3E8A  Its strongest point is its excellent mobility. A104 M4A3E8A  It accelerates very quickly on all grounds, and loses little energy in turns which makes it an ideal flanking tank. A104 M4A3E8A  Anyone who underestimates this gem will very soon become a smoking wreck. A104 M4A3E8A 

It appeared in the gift shop in October 2014 to mark the release of the movie Fury. A104 M4A3E8A  It was removed at the end of the promotion and, although Wargaming marketed it as being a one off chance to get one, appeared later once more 8. A104 M4A3E8A 12.

If you enjoyed the M4, but wished it was faster, then you'll love this tank. A104 M4A3E8A  Like the M4A3E2, it gets the more powerful Ford GAA engine. A104 M4A3E8A  Unlike the E2, it doesn't have a bunch of extra armor welded on. A104 M4A3E8A  As a result, this tank is fastest and most maneuverable of the Sherman variants. A104 M4A3E8A  It can also take advantage of a Vertical Stabilizer. A104 M4A3E8A  Tier 6 tanks of other nations cannot. A104 M4A3E8A  It can be quite helpful on a fast and maneuverable tank such as this one. A104 M4A3E8A 

The E8 has 2 strongpoints in it's armor; the turret and the beaklike 101mm lower glacis; However, the 'Fury' variant does not share the former of the two. A104 M4A3E8A   The 101mm beak armor plating is similar to other tanks of the similar chassis. A104 M4A3E8A  It's the same slope as the front upper armor plating and a few angles can bounce the KV-1S's feared 122mm D25T gun and give a chance for the E8 to retreat and regroup or engage and destroy the enemy with the M1A2's superb rate of fire. A104 M4A3E8A 

Run and gun tactics are a must with the E8, as it has enough speed and maneuverability to circle many heavier tanks due to their inferior turret traverses. A104 M4A3E8A  The higher than average gun depression angle allows the E8 to take up hull-down positions quite effectively as well. A104 M4A3E8A  With the rapid rate of fire the E8 can devastate tier 7 and below tanks. A104 M4A3E8A 

The E8 tends to be most successful as a flanker, a sniper or a passive scout. A104 M4A3E8A  It has the speed and maneuverability to succeed at flanking where the E2 couldn't. A104 M4A3E8A  This lets it hit the sides more easily, where the low-penetration is less of an issue. A104 M4A3E8A  The high rate of fire, combined with a Deadeye perk on the gunner will devastate any victim. A104 M4A3E8A  However, make sure your target is busy with one of your team mates or is isolated, or more often than not you'll be the one dying, instead of your target. A104 M4A3E8A  

If flanking is not an option, then sniping is entirely possible. A104 M4A3E8A  However, the lower accuracy, low penetration and low alpha damage tend to reduce its role. A104 M4A3E8A  Still, passive scouting is entirely viable, with its 370 meter view range. A104 M4A3E8A  

Unfortunately, with the addition of the Cromwell medium tank on the British line, this tank becomes somewhat redundant, as the Cromwell can do anything the Easy 8 can do, except it's faster and smaller with a higher penetrating and damaging gun with better accuracy. A104 M4A3E8A  However, there are a few niche bonuses to the E8 somewhat beneficial to use - the ability to use Vertical Stabilizer (if you can afford 500k for it), thicker effective hull armor, marginally superior view range, and the decent turret armor when combined with the gun mantlet. A104 M4A3E8A  The sheer ROF can also hold back multiple tanks from a choke point as well as your teammates arrive to reinforce. A104 M4A3E8A 

On a side-note: if the E8 were accurate to its design during WWII, the E8 would have wet-ammunition storage automatically, an evolutionary improvement over older models. A104 M4A3E8A

|HistAcc= Fury is intended to closely match what can be seen on the battlefield. A104 M4A3E8A  The tank which portrayed Fury in the film is actually a M4A2E8 and not a M4A3E8. A104 M4A3E8A  The Fury tank was loaned  by Bovington Tank Museum in England and then dressed by the studio. A104 M4A3E8A 

|History=
[[image:M4a3E8 Korea. A104 M4A3E8A jpg|thumb|200px|left|M4a3E8 at army maintenance depo in Korea]]
The official name is the M4A3(76)W HVSS, but "Sherman Easy Eight" is the nickname this tank is widely remembered. A104 M4A3E8A  Sherman M4A3E8 earned the nickname from its experimental E8 designation. A104 M4A3E8A  This new variant entered into WWII late in the war (Dec 1944), and was kept in service in various western allied nations deep into the Cold war. A104 M4A3E8A  











==Evolutionary differences from the prior Sherman variants==

This tank sported the much-vaunted HVSS (horizontal volute spring suspension) wide track and suspension upgrade. A104 M4A3E8A  HVSS suspension increased the Sherman's weight by 2950lbs with the T66 single-pin track and 4780 lbs with the T84 double-pin track. A104 M4A3E8A  HVSS allowed the installation of wider tracks, thereby decreasing the tank's ground pressure, and eased maintenance on the running gear since the bogie no longer had to be disassembled to remove road wheels. A104 M4A3E8A  HVSS also provided more wheel travel, which gave the tank an easier and more stable ride, it also made the tank a much more stable firing platform. A104 M4A3E8A  

The turret was also enlarged to accommodate the more powerful 76 mm gun. A104 M4A3E8A  Muzzle velocity of the 76 mm cannon, the vehicle's primary armament, was 792 m/sec, causing penetration of 101 mm of armor at a distance of 1,000 yards (914 m). A104 M4A3E8A  Maximum range of the cannon in indirect fire mode was 15,000 yards (13,716 meters). A104 M4A3E8A  From it's predecessor, the M4A3E8 inherited glacis sloped to 47 degrees to the vertical, while driver and co-driver vision slots were changed to periscopes housed in the top of the hatches. A104 M4A3E8A

The most significant change that distinguished the "Easy Eight" from it's predecessors was the "wet storage" of ammunition to reduce fire risk in the event of penetration from an enemy AP round. A104 M4A3E8A  The primary place of storage of ammunition was moved from the side of the turret (dry storage) into protected folders on the floor of the tank under the turret (wet storage). A104 M4A3E8A 

Production of "Easy Eights" began in early 1944 and continued until April 1945. A104 M4A3E8A  The "Easy Eight" became the standard tank of the American 3rd and seventh Army in Europe, and after the war, was successfully deployed in Korea and the Middle East. A104 M4A3E8A  In the postwar years, it was included in the armament of various Western Allied armies. A104 M4A3E8A  A total of 4,542 M4A3 tanks of both suspension types were produced. A104 M4A3E8A
