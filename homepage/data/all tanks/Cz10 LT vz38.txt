|InTheGame_pros= 
* 37 mm Škoda A23 gun uses a 3 shell magazine with 1 sec. Cz10 LT vz38  shell cycle and decent 5 sec. Cz10 LT vz38  (4. Cz10 LT vz38 5 sec. Cz10 LT vz38 -100% crew) for full reload
* Good standard AP penetration of A23 gun for tier III with an average of 82mm pen
* Final turret upgrade (Pz. Cz10 LT vz38 Kpfw. Cz10 LT vz38  38 (t) Ausf. Cz10 LT vz38  G) receives 50mm of armour to the turret mantlet

|InTheGame_cons= 
* 25mm of frontal hull armour has limited use throughout all tiers because it is only reliable against low tiers/calibres
* 15mm of side and rear armour is susceptible to damage from all tiers/types of ammunition if exposed
* Final engine is still less powerful than 38(t) engine, therefore requiring more consideration on maintaining speeds
* Top gun has only -5° depression

|InTheGame_research= 
*First, research the 37mm Skoda guns (First is a8 model, then a7 model). Cz10 LT vz38 
*There are 2 options for grind, go to ST vz 39 for play Tier IV medium or research the tracks for more traverse speeds and more weights
*After that, you need to research the turret for grinding the final gun, which is 37mm Skoda a23 autoloading gun for perfect DPM. Cz10 LT vz38 
*Radio and Engine are options will be choose to research for elite of this tank. Cz10 LT vz38

The advantage of this tier III unit once fully upgraded are that it possesses varying degrees of tactical flexibility throughout tiers III to V while having a cannon capable of retaining some effect throughout all of the tier match ups that it can encounter. Cz10 LT vz38  The 37 mm Škoda A23 allows the tank to fire for effect throughout all the different tier match ups due to higher than average 82 mm pen and decent rate of fire. Cz10 LT vz38  However, in critical situations where it is required to engage armour thicker than 70mm or thinner armour that has significant angling or sloping, usage of the ACPR magazine rounds with 115 mm pen. Cz10 LT vz38  are recommended to increase the round reliability. Cz10 LT vz38 In terms of mobility, this tank uses the 140 hp Praga TNHPS (dvojkarb. Cz10 LT vz38 ) final engine which permits this tank to attain its max. Cz10 LT vz38  speed of 42 km/h on even ground but requires stable terrain, linear movement and minimal turning to maintain that speed consistently. Cz10 LT vz38  This issue differentiates it from its german 38 (t) counterpart which has the same top speed but has a more powerful 200 hp final engine. Cz10 LT vz38  While the frontal hull can deflect low tier/calibre ammunition in critical situations, it is not too reliable and care must be taken at all tiers to minimize hull exposure when possible while seeking effective concealment. Cz10 LT vz38  The upgraded turret performs slightly better in this regard with 50mm of armour to enhance the protection of the crew and modules within the turret, however it is still flat therefore only rendering its base thickness effective so caution must be taken as with the hull, especially in higher tier matches. Cz10 LT vz38  Caution must be taken not to fall within view range of TD nests due to the high damage/pen of most td shells and the very limited 220 hp of this unit which must be maintained to secure any degree of survivability throughout a match. Cz10 LT vz38  For those who intend to keep this unit in the long term, generally good equipment to add for increasing performance are: Improved Ventilation for all around crew performance, EGLD for reducing aim time between shots, especially useful for cutting the aim time of the the 37 mm Škoda A23 between rounds and coated optics for improving the spotting capability


'''- Tier III match:''' The LT vz. Cz10 LT vz38  38 can assume a variety of medium tank tactics such as active flanking, supporting/suppressive fire and some spotting. Cz10 LT vz38  

'''- Tier IV match:''' The LT vz. Cz10 LT vz38  38 can be effectively used for supporting fire or cautious spotting as a second line tank on the flanks of the maps most used by lights and mediums and to provide itself as an interceptor to enemy light tanks who breach the front lines for reconnaissance purposes or attacking allied spg's. Cz10 LT vz38  Attacking heavy armoured medium or heavy tanks (e. Cz10 LT vz38 g Matilda, B1) at close range up to 200m should be avoided unless their hp is significantly reduced, and the situation is critical. Cz10 LT vz38 

'''- Tier V match:''' The LT vz. Cz10 LT vz38  38 should typically be relegated to 2nd or 3rd line duties such as providing supportive fire from medium to long range, intercepting enemy light tanks that breach through  the front lines, or if the situation calls for it, some cautious passive spotting. Cz10 LT vz38  Attacking Tier V heavy tanks (e. Cz10 LT vz38 g. Cz10 LT vz38  KV-1, Churchill I) or heavy armoured medium tanks (e. Cz10 LT vz38 g. Cz10 LT vz38  Matilda, B1) at close range up to 200m should be avoided unless their hp is significantly reduced, and the situation is critical. Cz10 LT vz38  


'''Suggested Crew Skills and Perks:'''

'''Camouflage:''' A useful skill for small, compact light tanks such as this one. Cz10 LT vz38  
Further diminishes the ability of most enemy tanks of tiers II to V to spot you, considering that many tanks within these tiers already have low average view ranges to start with

'''BIA:''' Useful for boosting overall crew performance, especially if paired with other crew enhancing units such as Improved Ventilation or meal consumables. Cz10 LT vz38  
Can also be used as a substitute for Improved Ventilation if the objective is to replace it with other equipment of choice. Cz10 LT vz38 

'''Sixth Sense:''' Good skill to have if it is preferred to know any moment the tank is spotted

|History= 
The LT vz. Cz10 LT vz38  38 (Lehký tank vzor 38, Light Tank model 38) was a Czechoslovak tank of pre-World War II design. Cz10 LT vz38  Manufacturer's designations included TNH series, TNHPS, LTP and LTH. Cz10 LT vz38  <br />
After Czechoslovakia was taken over by Germany, it was adopted by the German Army, seeing service in the invasions of Poland, France, and Russia. Cz10 LT vz38  The German designation was [[Tank:Pz38t|Panzerkampfwagen 38(t)]]. Cz10 LT vz38  The (t) stands for tschechisch, the German word for Czech. Cz10 LT vz38  Production ended in 1942, when its armament was deemed inadequate. Cz10 LT vz38  In all, over 1400 were manufactured. Cz10 LT vz38  The chassis continued to be produced for the Marder III (1942-1944) with some of its components used in the later Jagdpanzer 38 (1944-1945) tank destroyers, turretless assault guns, anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns.
