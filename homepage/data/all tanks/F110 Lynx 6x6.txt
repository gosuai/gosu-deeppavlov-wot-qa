|InTheGame_pros= 
* Access to "rapid mode" - gains improved top and reverse speed at the cost of steering
* Good penetration, shell velocity and gun handling
* Good HE penetration, ideal to counter enemy light tanks and artillery, or hit sides/rear of heavier targets
* Good gun depression and very fast turret traverse speed
* Very good camouflage values, also a fairly small target


|InTheGame_cons= 
* Virtually unarmored with a very low hitpoint pool, poor survivability
* Pathetic viewrange, even when fully boosted it does not reach 400 metres
* Loses a lot of speed if the wheels get damaged
* Weak fuel tanks, high risk of being set on fire


|InTheGame_performance= 

|InTheGame_research=
* The top radio carries over from the Hotchkiss EBR and should be installed immediately
* Research the suspensions for a much needed steering improvement
* Research the engines
* Research the top 90mm gun

The Panhard AML (Auto Mitrailleuse Légère, or "Light Machine Gun Car") is a fast, long-ranged, and relatively cheap armoured car with excellent reconnaissance capability. F110 Lynx 6x6  Designed on a small, lightly armoured 4×4 chassis, it weighs an estimated 5. F110 Lynx 6x6 5 tonnes—much lighter than a tank—and is therefore more suited to rapid airborne deployments. F110 Lynx 6x6  Since 1959 AMLs have been marketed on up to five continents; several variants remained in continuous production for half a century. F110 Lynx 6x6  These have been operated by fifty-four national governments and other entities worldwide, seeing regular combat. F110 Lynx 6x6
