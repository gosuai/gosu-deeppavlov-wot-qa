 * Ideal crew trainer for the Chinese heavy tank line

|InTheGame_cons=

* Low penetration
* Bad gun depression
* Subpar accuracy and aim time
* Lower side armor (behind the tracks) is only 80mm thick
* Frequent fuel tank, ammo rack and engine critical damage

This tank plays more or less like an IS3 but with the stock 122 mm gun. Ch03 WZ-111  
Due to low accuracy you need to stay close to the combat. Ch03 WZ-111  Strong armor usually bounce most of 7-8 HT's shells but TD's and 9 tiers can easily penetrate you and damage the ammo-rack. Ch03 WZ-111  Try not to angle the hull too much on the WZ-111 as it is a pike nose; thus it will only weaken the strength of the upper plate. Ch03 WZ-111  In addition, by reducing the angle you deny the enemy shots at your weak side armour. Ch03 WZ-111  This gives the WZ-111 an advantage over the other Chinese premium heavy, the [[112]], which needs to be angled more due to its flat front armour. Ch03 WZ-111

|History=
The WZ-111 was a Chinese attempt to improve upon the Soviet T-10 heavy tank development. Ch03 WZ-111  Once completed, WZ-111 was supposed to replace all Soviet made IS-2 and IS-3 tanks in PLA service . Ch03 WZ-111  However, due to the design shortcomings, only one prototype was completed before the fall of 1964 when development was cancelled. Ch03 WZ-111  

==Design features==
Flaws that were found during initial tests including a heavy and very cramped turret interior, insufficient armor on the hull, and  a weak and unreliable engine that was struggling to propel the overall mass of the vehicle. Ch03 WZ-111  Most of the technology used in the WZ-111 were copies of earlier, close to obsolete Soviet solutions. Ch03 WZ-111  Turret design was cast steel with welds on the roof area fitted with two crew hatches and a commander's periscope. Ch03 WZ-111   Suspension consisted of seven road wheels with internal shock absorbers, three support rollers, and a drive sprocket positioned at the rear with a removable ring gear and guide wheel. Ch03 WZ-111  The transmission was similar to the one in the IS series, and featured a multi-disc dry main clutch, eight gear transmission with dual, planetary rotation mechanism, and a final drive. Ch03 WZ-111  The engine was a Chinese made unlicensed copy of the B11 diesel, with the maximum power output at 520 horsepower. Ch03 WZ-111  Maximum speeds achieved during tests was 35 km/h. Ch03 WZ-111  The body was made from welded plates, with a thickness of 13, 120, 90 and 60 mm. Ch03 WZ-111  The test prototype was preserved and today is placed on permanent display in the Chinese Tank Museum located near Beijing. Ch03 WZ-111 

|HistAcc=
Engine is considerably more powerful than in reality, with 600 hp compared to the historical 520. Ch03 WZ-111 
*Actual top speed is 35 km/h. Ch03 WZ-111  In World of Tanks, however, the WZ-111 can reach speeds of up to 50 km/h. Ch03 WZ-111 
*The NORINCO 12150L is the same engine used on the [[Type 59]], yet the horsepower value is inconsistent. Ch03 WZ-111
