|The Pz. G63 PzI ausf C Kpfw. G63 PzI ausf C  I Ausf. G63 PzI ausf C  C, (Or shortly called as "PzIC") became very popular quickly after its release in-game, and with good reason. G63 PzI ausf C  

It is extremely fast (one of the fastest tanks in the game) and highly maneuverable, rivaling even the Soviet now gone T-50-2. G63 PzI ausf C  It sports sloped 30mm armor on its front and is relatively well-armored for its tier. G63 PzI ausf C  Lower-tier tanks and machine guns will have difficulty penetrating its armor and an even harder time hitting one at full speed. G63 PzI ausf C  Its top gun, the 7. G63 PzI ausf C 92 mm Mauser, is a rapid-firing machine gun that holds 5 8-round bursts in its drum, meaning it fires 40 rapid shots before reloading with a good ~320 damage potential. G63 PzI ausf C  Despite its relatively low penetration of "only" 33mm, the 7. G63 PzI ausf C 92 mm gun can easily take out full-health tier 2-3 tanks within seconds with shots to spare. G63 PzI ausf C  The Pz. G63 PzI ausf C Kpfw I Ausf. G63 PzI ausf C  C also has great gun elevation arc angles which can assist with using cover and firing on the move. G63 PzI ausf C  The formidable burst damage potential and high maneuverability make this tank one of the best flankers and run-and-gun drive-by vehicles; it's great for its tier and a fun tank to play. G63 PzI ausf C  Many high tier players also tend to seal club with this tank because of its ridiculous stats. G63 PzI ausf C  This tank is now a Collector's vehicle. G63 PzI ausf C

At its tier, it is best played as an aggressive flanker. G63 PzI ausf C  All but the strongest vehicles will be quickly destroyed by its 7. G63 PzI ausf C 92 mm Mauser machine-gun, especially if shot from the sides or rear. G63 PzI ausf C  The high damage-potential and high maneuverability (turning speed and such) allow the Pz. G63 PzI ausf C  Kpfw I Ausf. G63 PzI ausf C  C to "carousel" enemies, that is, quickly drive past or around an enemy and unload into their weak sides and rear while forcing them to turn their turret and hull in an attempt to keep up. G63 PzI ausf C  This technique disorients unexpectant enemies while making its victim vulnerable to you and your teammates who may be right behind you, however, this trick requires high speed and works best on slow enemy tanks and tank-destroyers. G63 PzI ausf C  Find opportunities to flank, charge in, unload your 40 bullets, and run to reload. G63 PzI ausf C  Rinse and repeat. G63 PzI ausf C 

It rarely gets into tier 2 matches because it would dominate tier 2 tanks if they are freshmen. G63 PzI ausf C  But you will often get into tier 3-4. G63 PzI ausf C  Knowing the enemy tank stats is the key to win. G63 PzI ausf C 

The Pz. G63 PzI ausf C Kpfw I Ausf. G63 PzI ausf C C offers a choice between two guns, the same 2cm L/112 that you might know from the [[Pz. G63 PzI ausf C Kpfw. G63 PzI ausf C  II]] or a unique gun, the Mauser. G63 PzI ausf C  They have similar stats: the same accuracy, neighboring damage, and penetration. G63 PzI ausf C  Technically, the L/112 is more reliable due to its slightly better penetration and a faster clip reload, but the Mauser's sheer damage potential and huge burst length make it incredibly deadly in flanking maneuvers and a generally preferred choice. G63 PzI ausf C 

When in higher tier battles, typically Tier IV, penetrating enemy tanks becomes extremely hard. G63 PzI ausf C  A lot of tier 4s are invulnerable to your gun, even from behind. G63 PzI ausf C  But know your enemy! The [[Alecto]] and [[T40]] have low armor and are great opportunities to gain XP. G63 PzI ausf C  In any case, it is ill-advised to engage higher-tier enemies head-on. G63 PzI ausf C  It is more effective to scout enemies for your team and to attack SPGs when the opportunity presents itself (such as when the enemy is distracted and away from their base). G63 PzI ausf C  As a scout (especially with Binoculars or Coated Optics) or arty-hunter, this tank becomes very valuable to its team. G63 PzI ausf C  Furthermore, its powerful radio enables it to effectively keep in touch with its team when scouting. G63 PzI ausf C  As with any tank, being the underdog tier-wise is extremely dangerous, and care must be taken to avoid all enemy fire because your 30 mm armor is not at all effective against tier 4 vehicles. G63 PzI ausf C 

If you want to, you can use premium ammo and consumables to make it a "seal clubber" tank that will wreck other tier-IIIs, some tier IVs. G63 PzI ausf C  However, this is extremely expensive to operate. G63 PzI ausf C 

Overall, with fun and high-damage potential gun and being fast and highly maneuverable, this tank will surely be a keeper for light tanks aficionados. G63 PzI ausf C
