This tank, with regards to the high speed, well-sloped armor, the fact that it ''never sees Tier 5's'' on top of the generally poor skills of lower-tier pub match players, this is arguably one of the most fun tanks in the whole game. R34 BT-SV  Thanks to the rocket-like speed, ramming targets as a last resort is a possibility, though it is probably not recommended as you won't survive. R34 BT-SV  One of the ways this tank is best played is to do a drive-by on a group of enemies, using your combination of excellent speed and sloped armor to survive as you throw shots downrange. R34 BT-SV  Another viable option is to use your speed to get to good positions, allowing you to claim an area before the other team has a chance. R34 BT-SV  The gun itself isn't too bad either, even if it is under par in some areas like depression. R34 BT-SV  While it may have incredible acceleration and top speed, it comes at a price; its turning speed is abysmal. R34 BT-SV  This means you should think ahead so you don't find your tank plummeting off a cliff or straight into another tank. R34 BT-SV

|History= The BT tanks were "convertible tanks". R34 BT-SV  This was a feature designed by J. R34 BT-SV  Walter Christie to reduce wear of the unreliable tank tracks of the 1930s. R34 BT-SV  In about thirty minutes the crew could remove the tracks and engage a chain drive to the rearmost road wheel on each side, allowing the tank to travel at very high speeds on roads. R34 BT-SV  In wheeled mode the tank was steered by pivoting the front road wheels. R34 BT-SV  However, Soviet tank forces soon found the convertible option of little practical use in a country with few paved roads, and it consumed space and added needless complexity and weight. R34 BT-SV  The feature was dropped from later Soviet designs. R34 BT-SV 

Christie, a race car mechanic and driver from New Jersey, had tried unsuccessfully to convince the U. R34 BT-SV S. R34 BT-SV  Army Ordnance Bureau to adopt his Christie tank design. R34 BT-SV  In 1930, Soviet agents at Amtorg, ostensibly a Soviet trade organization, used their New York political contacts to persuade U. R34 BT-SV S. R34 BT-SV  military and civilian officials to provide plans and specifications of the Christie tank to the Soviet Union. R34 BT-SV  At least two of Christie's M1931 tanks (without turrets) were later purchased in the United States and sent to the Soviet Union under false documentation in which they were described as "agricultural tractors. R34 BT-SV " Both tanks were successfully delivered to the Kharkov Komintern Locomotive Plant (KhPZ). R34 BT-SV  The original Christie tanks were designated fast tanks by the Soviets, abbreviated BT (later referred to as BT-1). R34 BT-SV  Based both on them and on previously obtained plans, three unarmed BT-2 prototypes were completed in October 1931 and mass production began in 1932. R34 BT-SV  Most BT-2s were equipped with a 37 mm gun and a machine gun, but shortages of 37 mm guns led to some early examples being fitted with three machine guns. R34 BT-SV 

The sloping front hull (glacis plate) armor design of the Christie M1931 prototype was retained in later Soviet tank hull designs, later adopted for side armor as well. R34 BT-SV 

The most important legacy of the BT tank was the T-34 medium tank, arguably the most important tank of World War II. R34 BT-SV  In 1937, a new design team was formed at the KhPZ to create the next generation of BT tanks. R34 BT-SV  Initially, the chief designer was Mikhail Koshkin and, after his death, Morozov. R34 BT-SV  The team built two prototypes. R34 BT-SV  The light one was called the A-20. R34 BT-SV  The more heavily armed and armoured BT derivative, the A-32, was a "universal tank" to replace all the T-26 infantry tank, BT cavalry tanks, and the T-28 medium tanks. R34 BT-SV  Such a plan was controversial, but concerns about tank performance under the threat of German blitzkrieg led to the approval for production of a still more heavily armoured version, the T-34 medium tank. R34 BT-SV 

Along the way, an important technical development was the BT-IS and BT-SW-2 testbed vehicles, concentrating on sloped armour. R34 BT-SV  This proof-of-concept led directly to the armour layout of the T-34. R34 BT-SV
