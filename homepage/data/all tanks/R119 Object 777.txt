The Obiekt-777 was another radical re-design of the T-10 series that was
developed on paper as a potential replacement for the T-10M, but did not
progress to prototype stage. R119 Object 777  The Obiekt-777 also drew its origins from the
Obiekt-770, using the T-10 series hull but with seven large (750mm) diameter
road wheels with internal amortization and hydro-mechanical transmission. R119 Object 777 
The armament was to have been the 122mm M-62-T2, with 15 armour
piercing and 25 HE-FRAG rounds. R119 Object 777  The secondary armament was reconfigured
so that the co-axial weapon was a 7. R119 Object 777 62mm SGM instead of the 14. R119 Object 777 5mm KPV
of the T-10M, which allowed 3,000 rounds of ammunition for the co-axial
weapon to be stowed. R119 Object 777  A 14. R119 Object 777 5mm KPV was nevertheless retained as an AAMG,
located in a remote control mounting above the turret rear. R119 Object 777 

The original design drawings considered alternative engine options, one
of which was the installation of a V-12 gas turbine engine developing 850hp,
giving the 49. R119 Object 777 8 tonne tank (still inside the heavy tank limit by 200kg) a
maximum road speed of 50km/h. R119 Object 777  The crew was to be reduced to four due to
the use of an autoloader system. R119 Object 777 

Although reviewed as a design project with completed drawings and
options, the Obiekt-777 was not developed beyond concept stage. R119 Object 777
