|The Locust is a fast and small tank, reaching its top speed of 64kph pretty quickly regardless of terrain. A43 M22 Locust   Differences with its German counterpart, the [[T-15]], include higher penetration, while being much less maneuverable and having a somewhat lower view range. A43 M22 Locust   Thus it's not capable of driving in tiny circles at full speed. A43 M22 Locust   However, [[Equipment#Crew|Improved Ventilation]], a fully trained crew, and some driving experience with this tank can help neutralize these drawbacks. A43 M22 Locust   Unlike many premium tanks, the M22 Locust has no preferential matchmaking, but since update 9. A43 M22 Locust 18 Tier III will no longer see Tier V. A43 M22 Locust  

|InTheGame_pros=
* Good combination of high hit points for this tier, hp/ton ratio and a generous top speed
* Good penetration for its tier with cheap APCR ammo
* Good accuracy on the move, aim time, turret traverse speed and elevation arc and view range
* Camo values nullify over a fifth of the enemy's view range and even when seen, the Locust's small size makes it hard to hit
* Cutest tank in the game

|InTheGame_cons=. A43 M22 Locust 
* Poor agility combined with a low protection means you must avoid getting shot at whenever possible
* Ammo storage is easily hit and running out of ammo in the middle of a match is a very possible scenario
* Poor signal range, its role as an active scout is limited
* Luchs drivers will try to argue your cuteness

The M22 Locust is a fast and fun tank to play. A43 M22 Locust   When scouting don't rush out too far -- the range of its SCR 510 M2 radio is limited. A43 M22 Locust 

The 37mm M-6 gun penetrates well for its tier and can shred opponents with its high rate of fire. A43 M22 Locust   However, keep a close eye on your ammo stock and don't waste shots because the limited supply of 50 shells runs out quickly. A43 M22 Locust  

However, with your very high camo rating (especially with camo net, paint, and crew skills) you can be a very effective passive scout. A43 M22 Locust   Mounting binoculars will make you much more effective in this role. A43 M22 Locust   Mounting coated optics as well will allow you to switch between the roles as needed. A43 M22 Locust 

In a Tier III match you can use your high speed to get into early scouting positions or even active scout. A43 M22 Locust   If you're feeling particularly brave it can be quite an effective harasser and flanker. A43 M22 Locust   You should avoid tight turns that bleed your speed off too much -- sometimes it's better to go in a straight line into the next bit of cover. A43 M22 Locust

|History=
The Light Tank (Airborne) M22, also known as the Locust, began development in late 1941 in response to a request by the British military earlier in the year for an airmobile light tank which could be transported onto a battlefield by glider. A43 M22 Locust  At the time the request was made, the War Office considered using the equipment in Britain's fledgling airborne forces, which had been formed in June 1940 by order of the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. A43 M22 Locust  When officials at the War Office examined the equipment that would be required for a British airborne division, they decided that gliders would be an integral component of such a force. A43 M22 Locust  These gliders would be used to transport troops and heavy equipment, which by 1941 was to include artillery and some form of tank. A43 M22 Locust  Plans to transport an airborne tank went through a number of revisions, but by May 1941 it was considered feasible for a tank weighing 5. A43 M22 Locust 4 long tons (5. A43 M22 Locust 5 t) to be carried for 300 to 350 mi (480 to 560 km) in a glider, although the latter would have to be specifically designed for the task. A43 M22 Locust  In a conference held on January 16, 1941, it was decided that the General Aircraft Hamilcar, under development at the time, would be used to transport a single tank or two Universal Carriers. A43 M22 Locust 

A decision had recently been made by the War Office that light tanks were no longer to be generally used in the British Army; on the whole they had performed poorly during the Battle of France and were considered to be a liability. A43 M22 Locust  As a result the Vickers-Armstrong Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch light tank was now considered obsolete. A43 M22 Locust  This made it available for use by the airborne forces and it was chosen by the War Office as the tank to be transported by glider. A43 M22 Locust  However, it had not been designed specifically as an airborne tank or to be airmobile, and it also possessed several faults. A43 M22 Locust  Its size limited the possible crew to three—a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret—which was found to be too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. A43 M22 Locust  The gunner or commander, in addition to their own duties, had to act as loader for the 2-pounder, which caused delays in combat; a report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that since the commander had both to fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible. A43 M22 Locust  The War Office was also aware that the tank had a faulty cooling system that made the Tetrarch unsuitable for service in hotter climates, such as the Middle East and North Africa. A43 M22 Locust 

A purpose-built airborne light tank was therefore required to replace the Tetrarch, but the decision was taken by the War Office not to produce the tank in Britain due to a lack of production capacity. A43 M22 Locust  Instead the American government was approached with a request that it produce a replacement for the Tetrarch. A43 M22 Locust  This request was made by the British Air Commission in Washington, D. A43 M22 Locust C. A43 M22 Locust , with a proposal calling for a tank of between 9 t (8. A43 M22 Locust 9 long tons) and 10 t (9. A43 M22 Locust 8 long tons) to be developed, this being the maximum weight the War Office had decided could be carried by current glider technology. A43 M22 Locust  The proposed tank was to have a primary armament of a 37-millimetre (1. A43 M22 Locust 5 in) main gun and secondary armament of a . A43 M22 Locust 30-06 Browning M1919A4, and a crew of three. A43 M22 Locust  The specification also called for a maximum speed of 40 mph (64 km/h) and an operational radius of 200 miles (320 km). A43 M22 Locust  The turret and front of the hull were to have an armour thickness of between 40 millimetres (1. A43 M22 Locust 6 in) and 50 millimetres (2. A43 M22 Locust 0 in), and the sides of the tank a thickness of 30 millimetres (1. A43 M22 Locust 2 in). A43 M22 Locust  The United States Ordnance Department was given the task of developing the proposed tank, and in turn requested designs from three American companies: General Motors, J. A43 M22 Locust  Walter Christie and Marmon-Herrington. A43 M22 Locust  The design offered by Christie in mid-1941 was rejected as it failed to meet the specified size requirements, as was a modified design the company produced in November. A43 M22 Locust  At a conference in May 1941, the Ordnance Department chose the Marmon-Herrington design and requested that the company produce a prototype tank, which was completed in late 1941; it was designated the Light Tank T9 (Airborne) by the company and the Ordnance Department. A43 M22 Locust 


== Development history ==

The T9 had a crew of three and weighed 6. A43 M22 Locust 7 metric tons (7. A43 M22 Locust 4 short tons). A43 M22 Locust  It was armed with a 37-millimetre (1. A43 M22 Locust 5 in) main gun and a coaxial . A43 M22 Locust 30-06 Browning M1919A4 machine-gun, as well as two further machine-guns on the right-hand side of the bow. A43 M22 Locust  The main gun and coaxial machine-gun were mounted in a powered turret, which also had a gun stabilizer installed to allow the gun to be fired when the tank was moving. A43 M22 Locust  The T9 was powered by a 162 horse-power six-cylinder, air-cooled Lycoming engine, and the thickness of the armour varied; the front, rear and sides of the hull had a thickness of 12. A43 M22 Locust 5 millimetres (0. A43 M22 Locust 49 in) while the sloped portions of the hull had a thickness of 9. A43 M22 Locust 5 millimetres (0. A43 M22 Locust 37 in). A43 M22 Locust  The tank's engine was able to give it a maximum speed of 40 mph (64 km/h). A43 M22 Locust  The T9 was not primarily designed to be transported by glider, a significant change from the original request, but instead was to be carried under the belly of a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft, using four lifting brackets welded onto each side of the hull of the tank. A43 M22 Locust  The turret was designed to be removable so that it could be detached and transported inside the C-54 and reattached once on the battlefield. A43 M22 Locust  The loading took six men about twenty-five minutes, the unloading ten minutes. A43 M22 Locust  On top of this the aircraft required a proper airfield on which to land. A43 M22 Locust  However, the T9 was of the correct shape, weight and size to be carried inside a Hamilcar glider, suggesting that these dimensions had been chosen deliberately so that the tank could be transported inside a glider if required.

A number of changes were made to the prototype during testing. A43 M22 Locust  The main change was the addition of supporting steel beams to improve and strengthen the suspension of the tank, which increased the weight to 7. A43 M22 Locust 05 metric tons (7. A43 M22 Locust 77 short tons), the maximum weight that could be carried by a Hamilcar glider. A43 M22 Locust  Two new prototypes were ordered by the Ordnance Department in January 1942 and were delivered by Marmon-Herrington in November 1942. A43 M22 Locust  They were both designated T9E1. A43 M22 Locust  The new tanks incorporated a number of requested changes. A43 M22 Locust  The turret was altered in shape; it was lightened by the removal of the power traverse mechanism and the gyro stabilizer for the main armament. A43 M22 Locust  The front of the hull was altered from a stepped appearance to a more sloped profile, which would provide for a better ballistic shape; the two . A43 M22 Locust 30-06 machine-guns were removed from the bow of the tank and the suspension was altered to try and reduce the weight of the design. A43 M22 Locust  However, contrary to normal practice, the Ordnance Department had placed an order for the original T9 design in April 1942, before the T9E1 models were delivered in November 1942; 500 were ordered in April and this order rapidly increased to a total of 1900, with deliveries to begin in November. A43 M22 Locust  However, production difficulties and design changes caused this date to be delayed several times, and it was not until April 1943 that production on the T9 actually began. A43 M22 Locust 

Production of the T9 peaked at 100 tanks produced per month between August 1943 and January 1944; however, this number rapidly declined when the results of the British and American testing programmes were reported to the Ordnance Department, and only 830 T9s were ever produced. A43 M22 Locust  The faults discovered with the design led to the Ordnance Department giving it the specification number M22, but classing it as 'limited standard'. A43 M22 Locust  No American combat units were equipped with the tank, although some of those produced were used for training purposes and two experimental units were formed and equipped with Locusts. A43 M22 Locust  The 151st Airborne Tank Company was formed on 15 August 1943, despite concerns that there would be insufficient transport aircraft to deliver the unit into battle, and the 28th Airborne Tank Battalion was also formed in December of the same year. A43 M22 Locust  However, neither unit saw combat, due to the US Army's lack of interest in using them in an airborne capacity. A43 M22 Locust  The 151st Airborne Tank Company remained in the United States, shuttling from base to base throughout the war, and the 28th Airborne Tank Battalion was refitted with conventional tanks in October 1944. A43 M22 Locust  Some 25 Locusts were ordered in April 1944 for use in the European Theater of Operations, and delivered by September; although a small number were sent to the United States Sixth Army Group in Alsace, France, for testing, they were never used in combat. A43 M22 Locust  However, the British still required the M22 as a replacement for the Tetrarch and the first prototype Locust was shipped to Britain in May 1942 for testing, followed by the second prototype T9E1 in July 1943. A43 M22 Locust  Although they were of the opinion that the M22 possessed a number of faults, the War Office believed it would perform adequately as an airborne tank. A43 M22 Locust  Thus the tank received the official title of "Locust" and 260 were shipped to Britain under the Lend-Lease Act. A43 M22 Locust  The majority of the Locusts ended up placed in tank parks until they were scrapped at the end of the conflict, and only eight ever saw action with British airborne forces.

== Faults ==

Extensive testing of the M22 occurred in 1943 and 1944, and was conducted by both the Ordnance Department and the British Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) Gunnery School at Lulworth Military Range. A43 M22 Locust  These tests uncovered a number of faults and problems with the Locust. A43 M22 Locust  The AFV School noted that the process of loading the M22 into a C-54 transport aircraft took considerable time and involved the use of complex equipment. A43 M22 Locust  Overall the process took six untrained men 24 minutes, although it was believed this could be shortened with sufficient training. A43 M22 Locust  Unloading was also a long process, taking approximately ten minutes; it was noted that the time it took to unload the M22 from a C-54 on the battlefield meant that both the tank and aircraft would make excellent targets for enemy fire. A43 M22 Locust  Operational use of the tank would therefore be restricted to the availability of airfields large enough to accommodate a fully laden C-54, which might not be in the right geographical location or might even have to be captured in advance of a planned airborne operation. A43 M22 Locust  A heavy transport aircraft, the Fairchild C-82 Packet, was developed to specifically carry the M22 inside its fuselage and unload it through a set of clam-shell doors, but it did not enter service until after the war had ended. A43 M22 Locust  The US Army Armored Board released a critical report on the Locust in September 1943, stating that it was inadequate in the areas of reliability and durability, and indicating that it would not be able to be successfully used during airborne operations. A43 M22 Locust  By 1944 it was also realized that the design of the tank was actually obsolete. A43 M22 Locust  The armor of the M22 in several areas was found to be so thin that it was incapable of even resisting the armor-piercing ammunition of a . A43 M22 Locust 50 caliber machine-gun. A43 M22 Locust  Complaints were also made about the 37mm main armament, which was not powerful enough to penetrate the armor of most tanks used by the Axis powers. A43 M22 Locust  Similarly a report made on March 13, 1944 by elements of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment complained that when a high-explosive shell was fired from the gun, the resulting shell-burst was so weak that observers had difficulty in seeing where it impacted. A43 M22 Locust  There were also mechanical problems with the design, which caused it to be unreliable; the engine was also found to be underpowered, possibly due to problems with the torque characteristics of the engine or an inefficient transmission system.
