|InTheGame_pros=
* Good top gun for its tier, deals high amount of alpha against tier 3 tanks and lower. G83 Pz IV AusfA 
* Good speed and agility for a tier 3 medium when fully upgraded
* One tier lower than the T-28, which has similar horrible armor values. G83 Pz IV AusfA 
* Stock gun's rate of fire rivals that of the Matildas and deals just under 25% more damage per shot. G83 Pz IV AusfA 
* For its drawbacks, the equipment grind, and that to the Pz. G83 Pz IV AusfA Kpfw. G83 Pz IV AusfA  IV Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  D, are on the tolerable side. G83 Pz IV AusfA 
* Nearly as fast as the Soviet T-28 fully upgraded. G83 Pz IV AusfA  (Only 3 Km/h slower with top engine)
* Surprisingly good aim time on top gun despite its other properties. G83 Pz IV AusfA 
* Acceptable armor on the front of the second turret
* Good range on top radio
* Gun options allow for different play styles. G83 Pz IV AusfA 

|InTheGame_cons=
* Armor is an utter joke like the Soviet T-28, only slightly worse, Players not used to such armor will find it frustrating. G83 Pz IV AusfA 
* Top gun has very poor accuracy and albeit slow muzzle speed, stock gun also has accuracy that leaves a decent amount to be desired. G83 Pz IV AusfA 
* Commander's cupola stands out like a sore thumb. G83 Pz IV AusfA 
* Relatively slow reload on top gun
* Both guns have horrible penetration against higher tiers. G83 Pz IV AusfA 
* '''EXTREMELY''' susceptible to low tier autocannon fire. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A Pz. G83 Pz IV AusfA  I C or Pz. G83 Pz IV AusfA  II G can virtually kill this tank in one pass. G83 Pz IV AusfA 
* Somewhat poor acceleration
* Rather poor stock radio range
* Atrocious gun bloom, takes longer than advertised to fully aim the gun

The Pz. G83 Pz IV AusfA Kpfw. G83 Pz IV AusfA  IV Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A, even though possessing the title of the earliest non-premium German medium tank in the game, can prove to be a nightmare to play for new tankers. G83 Pz IV AusfA  Those who are experienced with the T-28 will have far fewer problems with this German cousin, but this tank differs from its soviet rival in a multitude of ways, each can trade blows with each other like Godzilla and King Kong, so to speak. G83 Pz IV AusfA 

The Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A can lower its gun an additional four degrees versus the T-28, but the T-28 can elevate its gun five degrees higher. G83 Pz IV AusfA  On the front, the armor of the second turret for both tanks is equal, but being a tier lower than the T-28, the turret of the Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A will be less likely overwhelmed, but not by much. G83 Pz IV AusfA  The Top gun of the Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A deals more damage than the one on the T-28 but trades this for less penetration and an inferior rate of fire. G83 Pz IV AusfA  The Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A is also less bulky than the T-28, making some options that were not viable in the T-28 practical, yet it will struggle a bit to reach top speed due to the mediocre power/weight ratio. G83 Pz IV AusfA  The T-28 is faster, but only slightly versus the fully upgraded Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A. G83 Pz IV AusfA  In addition, the T-28 has 10 extra meters of visual range fully upgraded versus the Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A, but the Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A has superior radio range compared to the T-28 when fully upgraded. G83 Pz IV AusfA 

Sniping with the top gun of the Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A is nearly impossible due to the poor accuracy, but is somewhat viable with the stock gun. G83 Pz IV AusfA  Brawling means near certain death in this tank due to the poor armor, as it will fail even against light tank autocannons in its tier, especially German ones. G83 Pz IV AusfA  The Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A is better suited to ambush flanking with its stock gun, coming in from the side to wreak havoc for a short while before leaving just as quickly as it appeared. G83 Pz IV AusfA  With the top gun, the Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A makes for a relatively good medium to short range counter-sniper, blasting at hostile tanks that use 'Peek-a-boo' tactics, especially in urban regions. G83 Pz IV AusfA  But do not forget you have absolutely horrible armor all-round, so if a low tier german light, or any other tank with a good autoloader or derp gun finds you in their sights, do not expect it to save you. G83 Pz IV AusfA  Keep moving, use cover (Especially indestructible walls and buildings) as much as you can, Hit enemies hard when opportunities open and then dive back into cover as soon as possible. G83 Pz IV AusfA 

|InTheGame_research=

* In order to boost the agility, and thus survivability of the Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A, it is best to research the top engine and upgraded suspension, which each give a boost to mobility. G83 Pz IV AusfA  Research the top turret to increase armor at the front so hulldown is more of an option. G83 Pz IV AusfA 

* Those who prefer counter-attacking tanks will want to get the top gun of this tank first, then the rest. G83 Pz IV AusfA 

* Obtain the top radio whenever possible, as this greatly enhances your ability to remain aware of the battle situation. G83 Pz IV AusfA 

* Lastly, research the Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  D, which will be a noticeable improvement over the Ausf. G83 Pz IV AusfA  A. G83 Pz IV AusfA

The 5 cm gun was actually the [[Gun/Germany#5 cm KwK 39 L/60|KwK 39 L/60]] and it was only tested on the Panzer IV Ausf D. G83 Pz IV AusfA  Its configuration on the Ausf A is fake. G83 Pz IV AusfA 
*Both engines are considerably more powerful than in reality, with 320 and 350 hp compared to the historical 250 and 300 respectively. G83 Pz IV AusfA
