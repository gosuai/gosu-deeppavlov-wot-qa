This tank plays much like other french light tanks. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  With a good top speed and maneuverability, active scouting is an option;it's generally dangerous to do so as many tanks will attempt to take you out, if they don't underestimate your damage. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  Passive scouting and support/sniping is a good role to give this tank. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  With the mere 90 damage per shot, many enemies will shrug off the damage, until you empty several more shots into them, sometimes even your entire clip. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal 

Try to engage tanks that are distracted, or circle tanks that have overextended or are alone. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  Artillery, tank destroyers, and heavies will fall to your gun if they are singled out and you can circle them. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  When possible, conserve ammo as you only have 56 shots (7 clips). F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  APCR will come in handy if you intend on fighting face-to-face. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal 

Camouflage is important on this tank, so the skill will come in handy, as your armor will rarely not be penetrated if you are shot. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  View-range increasing skills also come in handy to assist in scouting. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal 
 
Note that it is not possible to customize this tank with camo, emblems or inscriptions. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  The tank does get the 5% camo bonus for a camo paint by default. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal 

This tank had benefitted greatly from the changes in the match maker since patch 9. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal 18. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  It no longer faces tier 10s and even when low tier never has to face more than 3 tier 9s. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  This has reduced the hit point pool of the opposing team, negating the AMX 13 57's main weakness: It's low damage capacity. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  
Furthermore, the AMX13 57 now becomes top tier on a regular basis. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal  Under those circumstances, it transforms into a miniature [[AMX 50 100]], capable of destroying most enemy vehicles with a single clip. F69 AMX13 57 100 GrandFinal
