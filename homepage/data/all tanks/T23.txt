==Historical Info==
This experimental medium tank was developed from the end of 1942 through the summer of 1944. T23  The T23 was neither adopted for serial production nor took part in combat. T23 

The first T23 prototypes were completed in January 1943, and these vehicle were the first to be completed in the T20 series. T23  They differed from the other T20 series in using the electric drive transmission manufactured by General Electric. T23  They were also fitted with the vertical volute-spring suspension similar to that used on the Medium M4 Tank. T23  The armament consisted of the 76mm Ml gun. T23  As with the T20 and T22 series, projects were initiated for development of vehicles armed with the 75mm automatic and 3in guns. T23  Designated T23E1 and T23E2 respectively, these projects were cancelled without development. T23  After tests of the T23 pilot vehicle, production was authorized for 250 of these vehicles. T23  The production model differed in several ways from the pilot vehicle: the 76mm Ml gun was replaced with the model M1A1, a vision cupola was provided for the commander, and the gun-ring hatch mounting the . T23 50 caliber AA machine-gun was moved to the loader's position. T23  Production commenced in November 1943, and continued through to December 1944, but none were shipped overseas. T23  Though this vehicle did not see active service, features tried and developed in the T20-T23 series were incorporated into M4 vehicles, in particular; the T23 type turret and 76mm gun, HVSS, and the simplified 47° hull front. T23  Research work on these vehicles also played a big part in the development of the T25 and T26 Medium Tank. T23
