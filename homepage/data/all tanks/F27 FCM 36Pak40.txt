|With a thinly armored, open-top superstructure and weak engine, the FCM 36 Pak 40 has a hard time defending itself when caught in the open and needs to be thoroughly concealed. F27 FCM 36Pak40   When at a safe distance however, the FCM's powerful 75mm cannon and extremely high 400m view range enable it to do a great amount of damage in very little time. F27 FCM 36Pak40

The FCM 36 Pak40 is probably the deadliest tier 3 tank destroyer. F27 FCM 36Pak40  The penetration is good, not very outstanding, the alpha damage is decent. F27 FCM 36Pak40  What makes the gun of the FCM unique is its outstanding accuracy and aim time, it can easily hit targets that are far away, also fast moving light tanks are vulnerable to this laser-sniper cannon. F27 FCM 36Pak40 

Despite the fact that it is a tank destroyer, it has a view range that even outclasses some tier X light tanks. F27 FCM 36Pak40  Its standard view range is 400 metres, without special equipment or skills. F27 FCM 36Pak40  You are going to outspot your enemies easily, so you can kill them without being spotted. F27 FCM 36Pak40  With all of these factors, the FCM is able to deal a devastating amount of damage in a short time. F27 FCM 36Pak40 

The mayor drawback is its mobility, and the tank itself if rather big. F27 FCM 36Pak40  The armor is quite thin, but the fact that you are a sniper with high view range makes the armor unimportant. F27 FCM 36Pak40 

====Compared to Similar Tanks====

Armed with the same 75mm Pak 40 cannon as the [[Marder II]], the FCM is often compared to it. F27 FCM 36Pak40   Despite the fact that two tanks share the same gun, the Marder's gun, oddly, has better penetration values. F27 FCM 36Pak40   The Marder also has a much wider traverse range, but gets this at a great cost to its accuracy and aim time. F27 FCM 36Pak40   Thus, the FCM is far better at aiming and hitting long-range shots. F27 FCM 36Pak40   Though both tanks are poorly armored and relatively slow, the Marder is often significantly less capable due to its lower accuracy, aim time, rate of fire, and view range, but maintains higher mobility compared to the FCM.

|History=[[image:FCM36 Pak40-d. F27 FCM 36Pak40 jpg|thumb|200px|left|FCM 36 Pak 40 was one of the vehicles from the Marder I family]]

The FCM 36 or Char léger Modèle 1936 FCM, was a light infantry tank that was designed for the French Army prior to World War II. F27 FCM 36Pak40  It had a crew of two and was equipped with a short 37 mm main armament and a 7. F27 FCM 36Pak40 5 mm coaxial machine gun. F27 FCM 36Pak40  Power was provided by a diesel engine. F27 FCM 36Pak40  The Germans captured 37 FCM 36s, using the administrative designation Panzerkampfwagen 737 FCM (f) for them. F27 FCM 36Pak40  In 1943, ten of the captured FCMs were rebuilt as Marder I tank destroyers, which were employed by the 21st Panzer Division in the Battle of Normandy in 1944. F27 FCM 36Pak40  Besides FCM 36, the Germans also used other captured French vehicles for the Marder I conversion; Lorraine 37L ''(170 produced)'', Hotckiss H35 ''(unknown number produced)'' and Hotckiss H39 ''(24 produced)''.
