* Incredible mobility -- very high speed limit and power for its little weight
* Improved overall handling compared to its predecessor, both maneuverability- and firepower-wise
* Has four axles -- harder to immobilize than previous armored cars
* Its oscillating turret and sleeker body proves to be a somewhat smaller target
* Has 40mm sloped front armor; may cause some trolly zero-damage shots

|InTheGame_cons= 
* Oscillating turret has limited gun vertical traverse, identical to the AMX-13's
* 90mm guns become less useful due to limited penetration and unimpressive alpha damage for a tier IX
* View range is still horribly low at 330m
* Lengthy hull can be unwieldy in confined spaces or close quarters

To begin with, this vehicle is among the ranks of those few high tier vehicles that perform great even freshly purchased; one could actually choose ''not'' to upgrade anything at all and still be able to advance into the EBR 105 with ease. F100 Panhard EBR 90   That being said, it could still use these upgrades:<br />
Suspension: The upgraded wheels, as per usual, improve turning characteristics and makes it a bit harder to immobilize. F100 Panhard EBR 90  Further they are required to mount full equipment. F100 Panhard EBR 90 <br />
Engine: The ''Panhard 12H 6000 mle. F100 Panhard EBR 90  63'' produces 80 more horsepower for an impressive five points of increased power-to-weight ratio and is required to be researched to move to the T10. F100 Panhard EBR 90 <br />
Radio: Research, if one hasn't done it on earlier vehicles. F100 Panhard EBR 90 <br />

The ''D. F100 Panhard EBR 90  921'' gun however, can be dubious: it improves the aim time, RoF and accuracy by only a really minor amount, however at the expense of having a very slow HEAT round, and it costs 43k experience. F100 Panhard EBR 90

|History= 
The EBR is an 8x8 wheeled reconnaissance vehicle based on the previous Panhard AM 40 P/Model 201, a light armoured car born before the Second World War, but remained only at prototype level. F100 Panhard EBR 90  After the war the new contest for a postwar armoured car saw the Panhard proposal as winner against other two french firms. F100 Panhard EBR 90  Despite the two basic concepts developed with the M. F100 Panhard EBR 90 201 were retained (8 wheels and oscillating turret), the new armoured car was a new project, much heavier (13 t vs 8), more crewed (4 vs 2), with a 75 mm gun (vs 25 mm) and with many other innovation, included a new anti-bullet tyres and very sloped armour, double pilot and machine gun inside the hull nose and aft. F100 Panhard EBR 90  The production only started after several years of testing, as Modele 51 in 1950 (limited production), followed by full production in 1954 with over 1200 vehicles being manufactured until 1960. F100 Panhard EBR 90  While being lightly armoured, the EBR was armed with the 90 mm FL-11 or 75 mm cannon known as the FL-10 or L/48 in a novel oscillating turret and supported by up to four 7. F100 Panhard EBR 90 5 mm machine guns: one coaxial with the main gun, one operated by the driver, one by the co-driver, and one by the commander, though the latter was not found on all EBRs. F100 Panhard EBR 90  The EBR had a crew of four (including two in the turret),[2] and was powered by a 200 hp (150 kW) 6 liter 12HD horizontally opposed air-cooled 12-cylinder engine (with dual carburetors and 6. F100 Panhard EBR 90 6:1 compression, enabling it to run on low-octane petrol). F100 Panhard EBR 90  Based on Panhard's two-cylinder automobile engine, it was mounted under the floor of the fighting compartment, which had the unfortunate effect of requiring the turret to be removed to conduct major engine repairs.

Service History

Portugal ordered 50 EBRs and 28 ETTs in 1956. F100 Panhard EBR 90 [4] After the outbreak of the Portuguese Colonial War, most of these vehicles were sent to Lisbon's African colonies for counter-insurgency operations, especially Portuguese Mozambique. F100 Panhard EBR 90  During the Carnation Revolution, an EBR 75 FL10 of the Armed Forces Movement confronted an M47 Patton crewed by loyalist troops in the Praça do Comércio. F100 Panhard EBR 90  The crews of both vehicles eventually stood down without incident. F100 Panhard EBR 90 

Aside from Portugal and a few newly emerging Francophone states in North Africa, the only export sales of the EBR were a few small quantities produced for the Indonesian Army and the West German Bundesgrenzschutz. F100 Panhard EBR 90 *
