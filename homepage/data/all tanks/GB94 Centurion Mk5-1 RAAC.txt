Basically a stock [[Centurion Mk. GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC  7/1]] with the 950hp engine, downtiered. GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC  Yet with significantly lower RoF (10. GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC 53 rounds/min vs 8 rounds/min, for the same gun in the Centurion Mk. GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC  7/1 and in this tank, respectively. GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC ), its playstyle rather resembles that of its brethren, the Cent. GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC  Mk. GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC  I. GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC  Differences in their armor layout does matter, but not to any great extent: if left unangled, the thicker UFP still won't hold against anything higher than 200mm pen, which isn't absent from even tier-7s; the sideskirts do pre-detonate HE and HEAT shells, but the hull sides aren't thick enough to resist most HEAT at its tier anyways. GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC  Those familiar tactics inherited from other British meds work highly effective in this vehicle, and it would prove to be very rewarding doing so.

This tank can be seen like the tier 10 '''M48A5 Patton''', at tier 8, although with a gun handling best described as average or even mediocre and a lower alpha value to compensate it for being a tier 8 tank. GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC   Still, the gun is good for its tier considering that most of its tier 8 peers have 200-212mm penetration value in average. GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC  The eggshell hull may be seen to be better than the frontal plate but the frontal plate (upper) can hold up at its tier.

GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC  It can have 300-400mm effective armor thickness and mantlet can absorb 420mm pen heat rounds from it, when it is hulldown.

GB94 Centurion Mk5-1 RAAC  In short, against high-penetrating premium rounds from tier 9 tanks and upwards, and from some tier 8 TDs, the turret can quite unreliable, but fortunately it can reliably bounce standard rounds from tanks of its peers and even from tanks above its tiers.
