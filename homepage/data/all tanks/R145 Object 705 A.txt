|InTheGame_pros= 
* Highest alpha damage among Russian heavy tanks, good gun handling
* Ridiculously strong turret armor with virtually no weakspots
* Hull sides are thick and covered with spaced armor, excellent for sidescraping
* Good top speed and acceleration
* Huge mass, thick armor and decent speed allow for effective ramming

|InTheGame_cons= 
* Poor rate of fire and DPM
* Long aim time and bad accuracy
* Bad gun depression
* Rear-mounted turret makes the tank rather inflexible
* HE shell damage is lower than average for a 152mm gun
