|InTheGame_pros=
* Strong frontal hull armor and turret armor
* Great gun handling and DPM
* 3rd highest standard penetration of all heavy tanks (default ammunition is APCR!)
* Superior top speed and less weight than [[IS-7]], giving it excellent mobility similar to mediums
* High speed and good armor make it good for ramming
* Front of the turret has the thickest displayed armor value in the game

|InTheGame_cons=
* Turret has a cupola weakspot unlike the IS-7's turret (it is small, though). R110 Object 260 
* Lower plate is easily penned like the IS-7's, but the thick beak from IS-7 is absent. R110 Object 260 
* Armor is preangled, like on IS-7, so angling makes UFP much weaker. R110 Object 260 
* Extremely low HP pool for a heavy tank, tied for 2nd worst HP pool out of all tier X heavies. R110 Object 260 
* Requires completion of all four sets of Personal Missions to earn. R110 Object 260 

|InTheGame_performance=
The tank feels a lot like a faster IS-7 with better gun handling and standard ammo penetration. R110 Object 260  In exchange it has lower health pool, slightly weaker side armor, a cupola weakspot, and lower alpha damage. R110 Object 260  This tank can reach high speeds with an excellent pw/wt ratio of nearly 20, and is very similar to medium tanks in terms of mobility. R110 Object 260
