This tank is a sniper and flanker hybrid. F113 Bretagne Panther  The armor while bouncy, is not thick enough to block the majority of tier VI weaponry. F113 Bretagne Panther  Brawling should be avoided when possible due to fairly low alpha damage and low armor. F113 Bretagne Panther  Hulldown is effective. F113 Bretagne Panther  The turret while not being the smallest target has a very high tendency to bounce shots at long ranges, and the L/70 will make short work of most tanks. F113 Bretagne Panther  Angling is not very effective due to the paper thin 40mm side armor, but can be used against small caliber guns to increase the chances of a bounce. F113 Bretagne Panther  Also due to the fairly large profile, one has to take extra time to make sure the bush they are sitting in (if abusing camo skill and nets) is big enough to hide the entire tank. F113 Bretagne Panther  It is also very hard to avoid enemy fire, since the tank is somewhat large for a medium (comparable to a small heavy), meaning that the only ways to take fire is in a hull down (moderately bouncy turret), or when angled properly with the lower plate preferably hidden (assuming the gun is a low end tier V or most tier IV guns, as anything with more then 130mm of penetration will go through the tank regardless of angle unless it gets a lucky bounce) 

The top gun is quite potent and capable of penetrating most tier VI and some VII tanks frontally. F113 Bretagne Panther  Alpha damage is lacking but the gun offers fairly high DPM. F113 Bretagne Panther  Sniping is very good with this tank as the L/70 has the accuracy to hit weakspots up to a range of about 300m and has enough penetration as to allow penetrations to the front of most tanks. F113 Bretagne Panther  

Overall this tank is quite similar to the pre 8. F113 Bretagne Panther 8 VK 30. F113 Bretagne Panther 01 (H), with good maneuverability, much better hull armor, slightly worse turret armor, and overall allowing the use of similar tactics. F113 Bretagne Panther  Anyone who enjoyed the VK 30. F113 Bretagne Panther 01(H) will most likely enjoy this tank. F113 Bretagne Panther  It should also be noted that this tank plays quite similarly to a historically accurate version of the Panther I, though the Panther historically was used more for sniping, and of course weighed more. F113 Bretagne Panther  

Still, take into consideration that the tank is designed for sniping or long range attacks. F113 Bretagne Panther  While close up flanking may be a viable tactic, it makes more sense to start out taking long range shots at exposed enemies, letting your team soak up damage. F113 Bretagne Panther
