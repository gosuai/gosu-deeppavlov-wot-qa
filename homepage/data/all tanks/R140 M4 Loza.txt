- High RoF and DPM

- One of the best gun depressions out of all Russian meds at -10°, also very strong gun mantlet

- Above average dispersion penalty, Vertical Stabilizer is also available

|InTheGame_cons= 

-Overall is a terrible Premium Tank; it really is a Russian M4A3E8 Sherman but being even worse; lacks the 105mm and a good engine. R140 M4 Loza 
- Short radio range

|InTheGame_performance= 
Basically a clone of the famous [[M4A3E8 Sherman]], but without its mighty Ford engine. R140 M4 Loza  Due to less engine power and additional weight, the Loza Sherman is nowhere as mobile as the Easy Eight. R140 M4 Loza  One might still apply the old tactics all the same, but usually will not prevail. R140 M4 Loza  A more comparable peer would be the [[Pz. R140 M4 Loza Kpfw. R140 M4 Loza  IV Schmalturm|Pz. R140 M4 Loza  IV Schmalturm]], both sharing the traits of weak hull and lacking mobility. R140 M4 Loza  While the Loza Sherman loses on accuracy and penetration, it does compensate back with better agility and a bit more DPM. R140 M4 Loza  Try supporting the more capable vehicles without exposing the hull or turret cheeks much, but don't shy away so far that its low accracy and penetration cease to effectively cause damage.
