The TL-1 LPC's playstyle is like that of an armoured medium. A127 TL 1 LPC  Don't be afraid to be the vanguard amongst your allies and be the one to bait enemy fire. A127 TL 1 LPC  Not only does the TL-1 have the armour to shrug off enemy fire, but it also packs enough of a punch to trade favourably with most equal tiered mediums. A127 TL 1 LPC 

When top tier you should play this tank as a frontline warrior. A127 TL 1 LPC  Use your fine gun handling and decent penetration to strike enemies with your higher alpha damage while only giving your enemies time to aim at your strong turret. A127 TL 1 LPC  This strategy also works against either stock or low penetration tier 9 tanks. A127 TL 1 LPC 

When you're facing off against tier 10 tanks you will start to notice the fact that your armour isn't that thick but well sloped. A127 TL 1 LPC  Tanks with high penetration will have very little difficulty penetrating your turret front and you will have to make the enemies completely mess up their shot if you want to pull off a bounce. A127 TL 1 LPC  In this case it's best to rely on your allies to take this high penetration fire whilst not forgetting that you can in fact take shots from lower penetration guns. A127 TL 1 LPC 

Stay aggressive. A127 TL 1 LPC  Almost all tier 8 mediums have relatively low damage per minute and the TL-1 is no exception. A127 TL 1 LPC  That is why you need to keep your gun firing to rack up the damage. A127 TL 1 LPC  If you're getting too aggressive your armour and mobility will help you retreat to safety.

A little bonus of the TL-1 LPC is it's included 3D style "Pretty Fly". A127 TL 1 LPC  Not only is it free camouflage and a nice looking skin. A127 TL 1 LPC  It also puts lots of clutter on your tank which can help obscure your cupola. A127 TL 1 LPC
