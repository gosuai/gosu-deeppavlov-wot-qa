* Great mobility, and very good agility. R99 T44 122 
* Pack-a-punch gun, very high damage per shot and penetration for tier 7 medium tank, even better than some tier 7 tank destroyers. R99 T44 122  
* Four-man crew configuration; works well for training higher-tier Russian medium tank crews. R99 T44 122 
* Preferred Match Making (MM+1). R99 T44 122  This means the T-44-122 only meets Tier 7 and Tier 8 tanks, like the E-25, Pz. R99 T44 122 M10 and AT-15A. R99 T44 122

Essentially a  T-44 with a 122mm D-25-44, the T-44-122 has a similar play style to the T-44 or T-34-2 equipped with a 122mm gun. R99 T44 122  To make best use of the high damage and low dpm of the gun, use of peekaboo tactics to minimize exposure. R99 T44 122  Keep distance and take cover from enemy tanks, peek out and hit them hard with the infamous Soviet's 122 mm Gun D-25T (which can be found in most Soviet Heavy tanks like the IS, IS-2, KV-3 and IS-6)and retreat to cover. R99 T44 122  Early in the battle, use your speed to take advantage to spot before enemy, aim beforehand, hit them right when they appear and fallback, wait for teammates. R99 T44 122  Don't overextend as you can easily be swarmed and killed thanks to your low dpm. R99 T44 122  During mid game, work as a second line support tank. R99 T44 122  In late game, use your high damage gun and mobility to carry/KS. R99 T44 122  In addition, the T-44-122 reloads faster than the tier 8 T-44 equipped with the 122 mm D25-44 gun. R99 T44 122 

Like tier 8 T-44, the T-44-122 has fragile internal modules, and is prone to taking damage or catching fire from hull shots. R99 T44 122  The ammo rack espeically can easy damaged when get hit on left side of the tank. R99 T44 122  While similar and based off the T-44, the tank has less armour, and it shouldn't be relied upon unless there is no other option. R99 T44 122  In particular, the turret cheeks and driver hatch are common and larger targets. R99 T44 122  The T-44-122's armour should only be rely when facing tier 5 and some tier 6 tanks. R99 T44 122  Don't let that side armour on fool you, you can't sidescrape with T-44-122 when facing tier 7 and 8 tank anyway

Overall, the T-44-122 has the Tier 8 mediums mobility, tier 8 Pack-a-punch gun, very good credits making ability and especially MM+1 (meets only tier 7 and 8), make this tank very strong, and it is like a monster when played by a good/unicum player. R99 T44 122  It even works best in tier 9 battles (platoon). R99 T44 122  Just don't get hit from anything. R99 T44 122 

=='''Crew Skills'''==
As a premium tank, it is generally not recommended that a dedicated crew to be run on the T-44-122. R99 T44 122  Instead, one should use an existing Soviet medium tank crew. R99 T44 122  If none exists, however, then the following options are probably the most viable. R99 T44 122 

* '''Repair''' as the first skill for all the crew members is a solid choice, allowing broken tracks or other damaged modules to be brought to operational condition as quickly as possible. R99 T44 122  Repair kits can thus be saved for more important modules like the gun or ammunition rack. R99 T44 122 
* A more specialized set of first skills would be '''Repair''' (Commander and Loader), '''Snap Shot''' (Gunner), and '''Smooth Ride''' (Driver). R99 T44 122  The loader only has perks available, which are not useful until they have reached 100%. R99 T44 122  '''Repair''' is the most viable option for the loader, which may later be swapped out for his perks. R99 T44 122  The combination of Snap Shot and Smooth Ride act like a Vertical Stabilizer, reducing the accuracy penalties while moving in a straight line or turning the turret. R99 T44 122  This can make a significant difference, especially given the T-44-122's terrible dispersion and aim time. R99 T44 122  '''Mentor''' may also be used instead of Repair if the emphasis is on getting the other crew members' skills up faster. R99 T44 122  Smooth Ride may be substituted with '''Off-Road Driving''' for improved overall mobility or '''Clutch Braking''', which is always useful on any medium tank for the increased hull traverse, allowing them to circling enemy tanks better. R99 T44 122 
* Upon reaching 100% on the first skills, dropping the commander's skill for '''Sixth Sense''' is highly advised, as it is one of the most important perks in the game. R99 T44 122  The loader's skill may be dropped in favour of '''Safe Stowage'''. R99 T44 122 
* '''Brothers-in-Arms''' is a good perk to have on any tank, but requires all crew members to have it at 100% before it works. R99 T44 122  The bonus to crew skills is particularly noticeable when combined with Improved Ventilation. R99 T44 122  It improves nearly every aspect of the tank's performance, but is generally better saved for later in favour of more important skills and perks like Repair and Sixth Sense. R99 T44 122

In the autumn of 1943 the design bureau of the Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. R99 T44 122  183, located in Nizhny Tagil (in the Ural Mountains, where most of the Soviet tank industry had been evacuated after Operation Barbarossa in 1941), started working on a vehicle that would have improvement opportunities in the future, under a direct order from Joseph Stalin. R99 T44 122  The intention was to retain the high mobility of the T-34 and provide it with heavier armour protection against modern tank guns. R99 T44 122  In November 1943, the chief designer, A. R99 T44 122  A. R99 T44 122  Morozov, presented the overall design of the vehicle and a model of the tank, which received the designation T-44 (Ob'yekt 136). R99 T44 122  The first prototype was completed by January 1944 and two more were completed in February. R99 T44 122  The first two prototypes were armed with 85 mm D-5T guns and received the designation T-44-85, while the third prototype was armed with the 122 mm D-25-44T tank gun and received the designation T-44-122. R99 T44 122  The D-25-44T tank gun was very similar to the basic D-25 field gun, but differed in some minor details including fixed single-piece ammunition to increase the rate of fire and a double-baffle muzzle brake. R99 T44 122  What allowed fitting such powerful armament in a medium tank weighing 30 tonnes was the construction of the hull with an innovative placement of the engine. R99 T44 122  Unlike most tanks, in the T-44 the engine was placed perpendicular to the axis of the tank. R99 T44 122  The hull was designed without sponsons. R99 T44 122  It was also much wider which made the crew compartment bigger and allowed the turret to be placed over the center part of the vehicle. R99 T44 122  This reduced the overall length of the vehicle. R99 T44 122  A big disadvantage to the vehicle was that its ammo rack was on the broad left side and was easily hit, often resulting in detonation of the ammo rack, which caused a lethal explosion. R99 T44 122  The thickness of the armour was 75 mm on the front of the hull and 90 mm on the front of the turret. R99 T44 122  The side armour was 45 mm thick and could be reinforced by 30 mm thick additional armour plate. R99 T44 122  All three prototypes were powered by the V-2IS diesel engine which developed 500 hp (373 kW). R99 T44 122  This first generation of prototypes featured a raised cast driver's hatch with an opening vision flap as well as mounting bolts in a ring around the base of the gun tube. R99 T44 122 <br />
<br />
Morozov's new medium tank design received a skeptical response. R99 T44 122  It was believed that putting a high-speed 12-cylinder engine with a working displacement of almost 40 liters perpendicular to the direction of travel would cause problems, including breaking the connecting rods. R99 T44 122  It was believed that decreasing the displacement of the engine compartment for the purpose of enlarging the fighting compartment was unnecessary and that moving the turret rearwards would limit the elevation angle of the main gun. R99 T44 122  However, it turned out that even though rotating the engine complicated the transmission by introducing an additional reduction gear - gear-train and fan drive, it also solved many problems. R99 T44 122  The cover of the engine and transmission compartment turned along with the radiator; this allowed easier access to the engine, transmission and batteries. R99 T44 122  The significant decrease in the length of the engine compartment allowed the turret to be moved rearwards, which in turn moved its rotation axis and the center of mass to the center of the hull, increased the accuracy of the main gun and decreased a chance that the turret could get stuck after getting hit in the turret ring with a projectile that ricocheted. R99 T44 122  The thickness of the frontal armor protection more than doubled without disturbing the center of mass or drastically increasing the weight of the tank. R99 T44 122  At the beginning of World War II the thickness of T-34 armor was considered enough. R99 T44 122  Improvements made to the T-34 during World War II included increasing the caliber of the gun (from 76. R99 T44 122 2 mm to 85 mm) and thickening the armor of the turret. R99 T44 122  No significant improvements were made to the hull. R99 T44 122  Increasing the size of the fighting compartment allowed the removal of floor ammunition stowage. R99 T44 122  The height of the tank was decreased by 300 mm, even though the turret remained almost the same. R99 T44 122  Removal of the conical pair in the transmission permitted fitting a more compact gear box and improved the control of the brakes and the steering clutch. R99 T44 122  Visibility from the driver's position was improved. R99 T44 122  The driver was protected from being splashed by water while the vehicle was fording. R99 T44 122  The new torsion bar suspension allowed easier crossing of rough ground. R99 T44 122 <br />
<br />
The first trials of the T-44-122 prototype took place in February and March 1944, but were unsuccessful due to gun failure, and the gun was returned to the No. R99 T44 122  9 factory for repair. R99 T44 122  In April and May 1944 the trials were resumed. R99 T44 122  Aside from standard trials, the T-44-122 was put in competitive trials against the captured German Panzerkampfwagen V Panther medium tank and the second of two first generation T-44-85 prototypes. R99 T44 122  The practical rate of fire was two to three rounds per minute due to the cramped turret and long, heavy ammunition. R99 T44 122  The vehicle had a very limited storage of only 24 rounds and this was considered insufficient for a medium tank. R99 T44 122  As a result, all further development of the T-44-122 prototype was cancelled. R99 T44 122 <br />
<br />
Like the T-44-122 prototype, one of the two first-generation T-44-85 prototypes went through competitive trials against the captured German Panzerkampfwagen V Panther medium tank. R99 T44 122  The second of the two first-generation T-44-85 prototypes was put in competitive trials against the T-44-122 prototype. R99 T44 122  The second prototype uncovered additional faults in the design. R99 T44 122  By May 1944 two second-generation prototypes were being built. R99 T44 122  These featured the driver's position moved rearwards so that his hatch was partially on the hull roof. R99 T44 122  The driver's vision flap was reduced to a plain square flap with rounded lower corners, in line with the glacis plate. R99 T44 122  These prototypes had prominent collars at the base of the gun tube, without the mounting bolts which were present in the first generation prototypes. R99 T44 122  The two prototypes also have differences between each other. R99 T44 122  One prototype had a splashboard on the glacis plate while the other had a smooth uncluttered glacis plate. R99 T44 122  One of these prototypes passed trials at the NIBT proving grounds near Kubinka in June and July 1944. R99 T44 122  This prototype weighed 31. R99 T44 122 3 tonnes and was armed with an 85 mm ZiS-S-53 gun. R99 T44 122  The turret front armour thickness was increased to 115 mm. R99 T44 122  Hulls side armour thickness was increased to 75 mm.
