| The final development of its tank destroyer tech tree, the Grille 15 is a far more reasonable conclusion to its respective branch's play-style than the enormous, hulking, DPM burst-damage monster known as the [[Waffenträger auf E 100]], which the Grille 15 replaced as the Tier X tank destroyer. G121 Grille 15 L63  Upon entering the fray, the Grille 15 was unsurprisingly met with a polarizing reaction from the community. G121 Grille 15 L63  Some players praised the new vehicle's dynamics and characteristics as much more familiar to what they were accustomed to with the previous vehicles of the branch. G121 Grille 15 L63  Others were simply relieved that they would no longer have to face the overwhelming, unbalanced firepower of the WT auf E100 on the battlefield. G121 Grille 15 L63  And the rest cried out in disappointment, having lost their team-slaying behemoth TD and received a much weaker, albeit much more sensible, vehicle in return. G121 Grille 15 L63 

However, despite the fact that the Grille 15 is nowhere near the "lane-crushing machine" status of the WT auf E100, it is still a capable Tier X Tank Destroyer with its own unique skill set. G121 Grille 15 L63  The most noticeable aspect of the Grille 15 is the extremely long-barreled 15cm gun for which the vehicle is named. G121 Grille 15 L63  It used to be the most accurate and fastest aiming gun in the game and on top of that, it fires highly damaging AP shells with excellent velocity. G121 Grille 15 L63  This could theoretically make the Grille 15 one of the best, if not ''the best'', sniper tanks in the game. G121 Grille 15 L63  Keep in mind however that this exceptional accuracy is only available when the vehicle is stationary, as any movement of the hull or turret will cause large aim-circle bloom which adds 3-4 extra seconds, if not minutes, to the aim time. G121 Grille 15 L63  And on the topic of movement, it should be noted that the Grille 15 can reach a very respectable top speed and re-position itself quite easily should the need arise. G121 Grille 15 L63  

The armor of the Grille 15, however, is extremely thin and totally unimpressive. G121 Grille 15 L63  A Grille 15 which finds itself in even a moderate center of attention from the enemy will almost certainly not survive long. G121 Grille 15 L63  Play this tank as a concealed sniper or as a fire support vehicle to heavily armored teammates who can protect your tank in order to maximize its potential and in turn its contributions to the battle.

|InTheGame_pros= 
* Most accurate and fastest aiming gun in the game (apart from strv 103b in siege mode). G121 Grille 15 L63 
* Good Shell Velocity further aids sniping capabilities. G121 Grille 15 L63 
* High top speed and power to weight ratio
* 750 Alpha Damage with decent reload
* Respectable gun depression and has pseudo-turret

|InTheGame_cons= 
* Paper-thin armor, extremely vulnerable to HE ammunition
* High aim-circle dispersion while moving hull or turret. G121 Grille 15 L63  Heavily negates amazing aim-time
* Gun gets often damaged, engine is located on front
* Low penetration on both AP and HEAT rounds for tier 10 TD
* Camouflage isn't nearly as good as its predecessor. G121 Grille 15 L63  In fact, the after shot camouflage is worse than that of many heavy tanks (for instance all Russians outperform the Grille 15 in this field) and even of some artillery (BC 155-58 has significantly better camouflage)
* Unlike previous tank, has not got 360* turret traverse
* Effectively outperformed by any other tier X TD. G121 Grille 15 L63  
* All weaknesses combined pretty much negate the few strong points this tank has, unless either played perfectly, or in a perfect scenario (such as enemy tanks charging in in a straight line in draw distance but outside view range). G121 Grille 15 L63  Overall, players are best advised to hold onto the Rhm Borsig and WT auf pz. G121 Grille 15 L63  IV until they find out if they enjoy the Grille 15. G121 Grille 15 L63  



|InTheGame_performance= 
The Grille 15 was introduced in Patch 9. G121 Grille 15 L63 15 to replace the [[Waffentrager auf E100]]. G121 Grille 15 L63  Unlike the FV 215-183b and Foch 155, the WT auf E100 was truly remomved, with original owners only gaining the Grille 15 in return. G121 Grille 15 L63  
The tank performs like an E25 with a high alpha gun and worse camo than the WT Pz. G121 Grille 15 L63  IV. G121 Grille 15 L63   It can run around the map going 55-60 kph which allows it to easily relocate after shooting to make up for its average camo values, although the fact that the turret doesn't traverse fully hinders this strategy a lot. G121 Grille 15 L63  Its accurate gun with fast aim time makes snap shooting very easy. G121 Grille 15 L63   A big threat is being circled; it may be fast but its traverse is subpar and you can easily be killed by heavies who out traverse you. G121 Grille 15 L63   You need to use your speed to stay safe and your gun to keep enemies at bay. G121 Grille 15 L63

(See the history page of the [[Panther]] for more information of the tank itself)

The in-game Grille 15 is a combination of the various Krupp proposals of Panther-based self-propelled guns, and the superheavy guns developed for use on various SPG's. G121 Grille 15 L63 

==Krupp Waffenträgers==

Krupp designed various Waffenträgers using the chassis of the Panther tank. G121 Grille 15 L63  These included the Grille 12 and the Grille 15, which would have used a 128mm gun and a 150mm sFh 43 gun respectively. G121 Grille 15 L63  Wooden models of the vehicles, which included the related Heushrecke 12 and 15 designs, were ready in January 1943. G121 Grille 15 L63  The prototype vehicles were supposed to be ready in September 1943, but in April, it was decided to produce only one prototype of Grille 12/15, while in May 1943, both the Heuershrecke 12 and 15 were cancelled. G121 Grille 15 L63  In the meanwhile some work on the Grille 12/15 continued. G121 Grille 15 L63  However, as with many German late war projects, the war needs intervened and the Grille 12/15 was eventually cancelled in late 1943. G121 Grille 15 L63  A mock-up of the Grille 12/15 was made, though it looks very different from the Grille 15 in-game. G121 Grille 15 L63 

==Superheavy Guns==

In late March of 1944, the Krupp design bureau developed two guns: the 15 cm StuK L/63 and 17 cm StuK L/53. G121 Grille 15 L63  According to calculations, both could penetrate 200 mm of armour at 4 kilometers. G121 Grille 15 L63  It is not known who the intended target for these monsters was, but both guns appear in Guderian's report detailing potential developments on April 7th, 1944. G121 Grille 15 L63 

The designation of both guns dictated that they were meant for SPGs. G121 Grille 15 L63  These guns could potentially be installed on relatively light Panther or Tiger based vehicles, but in reality only one carrier was built, the 17 cm Kanone 72 (Sfl) Geschuetzwagen Tiger otherwise known as Grille 17. G121 Grille 15 L63  The choice of chassis for gigantic anti-tank guns remained open. G121 Grille 15 L63 

|HistAcc=
* While it is possible that the Grille 15 was revived and redesigned as a platform for the 15 cm L/63 gun, there are no publicly known plans, blueprints, or documents for that project. G121 Grille 15 L63
