|Designed to replace the [[T-34]], and actually historically predating the [[T-34-85]], the T-43 features increased hull armor and a new torsion bar suspension replacing the T-34's Christie suspension, but retains the same weapons as the T-34-85 and has similar turret protection. R23 T-43  As a Tier 7 medium tank, the T-43 is expected to face Tier 9 tanks using the same gun that the T-34-85 had at Tier 6, which can be frustrating at times, to say the least. R23 T-43

|InTheGame_pros=
* Excellent DPM, with relatively fast rate of fire. R23 T-43  (Made even better with rammer, vents, and BiA. R23 T-43 )
* Good depression and elevation angles, especially for a Soviet tank. R23 T-43 
* Good turret armor, combined with decent gun depression. R23 T-43 
* Good side and rear armor. R23 T-43  Surprisingly good at side-scraping. R23 T-43 

|InTheGame_cons=
* Above average resistance values and mediocre P/W ratio mean rather sluggish mobility. R23 T-43 
* Average at best gun handling. R23 T-43 
* Exposed fuel tanks can easily catch fire from a penetrating hit to the front. R23 T-43 
* Mounts the same exact 85mm gun the T-34-85 gets, and cannot mount it immediately at stock. R23 T-43 
* Bad stock gun makes for a terrible initial grind

The T-43 plays the same as the T-34-85, and is generally considered the mid runner of the Tier 7 medium tanks, much like how the T-34-85 was also the mid runner among the Tier 6 medium tanks. R23 T-43  It generally does not have any particularly outstanding features, but will perform most roles competently, if not remarkably. R23 T-43 

Armament-wise, the T-43 retains the same guns as the T-34-85, but most disappointing is that the T-43 cannot mount the top gun, the '''85 mm D5T-85BM''', right from the start. R23 T-43  Though once mounted, it has a higher rate-of-fire on the T-43 than on the T-34-85. R23 T-43  It has good damage-per-minute for a Tier 7 medium tank gun, inferior only to the [[Comet]]'s OQF 77 mm Gun. R23 T-43  Like the Comet, however, this is countered by the gun's fairly low penetration, which means that outside of Tier 7 matches the T-43 will have trouble penetrating nearly all tanks from the front, and many from the sides. R23 T-43 

Mobility-wise, the T-43 is fairly decent, but unremarkable. R23 T-43  Being heavier than the T-34-85 while using the same engine, it has a lower power-to-weight ratio, and hence accelerates more sluggishly. R23 T-43  Having said that, the top speed is fairly decent, and it will have no problems relocating to other flanks as needed. R23 T-43  Maneuverability is, though not outstanding, good enough for a medium that is primarily a flanker. R23 T-43  

The T-43 does have better hull armor than the T-34-85, but must now face Tier 8 and 9 tanks on a regular basis, so it is not actually that much of an improvement. R23 T-43  It is useful against lower tier tanks, and angling will yield some lucky ricochets, but the armor should generally not be relied upon to protect it beyond its well sloped turret. R23 T-43  The module layout, combined with the generally more powerful guns that the T-43 faces regularly, means that even if it can survive the hits, it risks being crippled with modules or crew members knocked out. R23 T-43 

With all this in mind, the T-43 generally performs best as a second-line support tank or flanking medium. R23 T-43  It simply does not have the penetration and accuracy of the [[Pz. R23 T-43 Kpfw. R23 T-43  V Panther]] to perform as a sniper, nor does it have the armor or agility to engage in close combat with enemy tanks without taking heavy damage and/or crippled modules. R23 T-43  Picking your targets wisely should be a primary goal. R23 T-43  As the tanks great DPM, great alpha (for a DPM oriented cannon), strong turret armor and sloped armor can give weaker tanks a tough time. R23 T-43  Exploiting weaker enemies will also allow your team to take on tougher targets. R23 T-43  

Specific mention should be made about the T-43's fuel tank, which is placed right next to the driver to his left. R23 T-43  Hits to the front can damage the fuel tank, and if destroyed, the fuel tank will cause the T-43 to catch fire. R23 T-43  It is very important to be mindful of this. R23 T-43  There is also an ammo rack on the hull floor and on the rear right side of the second turret. R23 T-43 

An alternate choice to the D5T is the 122mm U-11. R23 T-43  Equipped with this cannon the T-43 can be played very aggressively in support of heavy tanks or in the company of other mediums. R23 T-43  The U-11 is able to damage most opponents reliably, albeit lightly, even from the front. R23 T-43  In addition the U-11 allows for consistent module damaging and crew killing shots that can significantly hamper higher tier vehicles. R23 T-43  However, there are two downsides to this play-style: 1) The sluggish acceleration makes it tough to get away after firing, unlike the [[T-34-85]], which can effectively employ hit-and-run tactics. R23 T-43  2) The damage potential against heavily armoured opponents is simply too low to be useful in tier 8 or 9 matches. R23 T-43  One-shot kills become nearly impossible and with the 122mm the T43 lacks the DPM to take the enemy down quickly with multiple shots. R23 T-43 

This enables the T-43 to engage opponents successfully at close range using circling tactics while keeping the enemy tracked. R23 T-43  So crippled, these enemies can then be picked apart by the T-43 and any allies with a shot at the enemy vehicle. R23 T-43 

=='''Crew Skills'''==
* Due to the fact that the T-43 takes a lot of module damage, going ll '''Camouflage''' as the first skills is helpful to reduce the chances of being detected and getting hit in  the first place. R23 T-43  As with most medium tanks, going all '''Repair''' for the first skills is also viable. R23 T-43 
* A more specialized set of first skills would be '''Situational Awareness''' (Commander), '''Snap Shot''' (Gunner), and '''Smooth Ride''' (Driver). R23 T-43  The loader only has perks available, which are not useful until they have reached 100%, '''Repair''' or '''Camouflage''' are viable options for the loader, which may later be swapped out for his perks. R23 T-43  The combination of Snap Shot and Smooth Ride act like a Vertical Stabilizer (which the T-43 does not have access to), reducing the accuracy penalties while moving in a straight line or turning the turret, and by extension, allowing the T-43 to get an accurate shot off faster after stopping. R23 T-43  Situational Awareness increase the tank's decent 360 m view range further. R23 T-43  '''Mentor''' may also be used instead of Situational Awareness if the emphasis is on getting the other crew members' skills up faster. R23 T-43  Smooth Ride may be substituted with '''Off-Road Driving''' for improved overall mobility. R23 T-43  '''Clutch Braking''' also a viable option for the driver. R23 T-43 
* Upon reaching 100% on the first skills, dropping the commander's skill for '''Sixth Sense''' is highly advised, as it is one of the most important perks in the game, especially for a medium tank. R23 T-43  The loader's skill is highly advised to be dropped in favor of '''Safe Stowage''', due to the T-43's highly vulnerable ammunition racks. R23 T-43 
* '''Brothers-in-Arms''' is a good perk to have on any tank, but requires all crew members to have it at 100% before it works. R23 T-43  The bonus to crew skills is particularly noticeable when combined with Improved Ventilation. R23 T-43  It improves nearly every aspect of the tank's performance, but is generally better saved for later in favor of more important skills and perks like Repair, Safe Stowage, and Sixth Sense.

|InTheGame_research=
* Most of the modules will have been unlocked on the T-34-85, including the top gun (the D5T-85BM) and engine (the V-54K), but mounting the gun requires second turret, which in turn requires the upgraded suspension, so the top priority is to unlock the '''T-43M suspension'''. R23 T-43  The suspension also has better terrain passability which makes you accelerate much faster. R23 T-43 
* Next, research the '''T-43 mod. R23 T-43  1943 turret''' in order to mount the D5T-85BM. R23 T-43 
* It may be a good idea to use the enhanced suspension equipment first, thus allowing the top turret and gun to be mounted sooner. R23 T-43 
* The '''V-2-44''' is automatically unlocked when the T-44 is researched and can be ignored. R23 T-43 
Note: It is possible to skip the engine upgrades in favor of simply moving on to the T-44, although this is not advised. R23 T-43

|History=
In 1942 the Soviet intelligence had information of the new German tanks Panther V and Tiger VI, and this resulted in a need of a new Russian tank to even the score in fire power and protection. R23 T-43  At first it was planned to up-armour the T34 m/43, but instead a larger turret was put to the same chassis that was altered inside. R23 T-43 
Two prototypes were built, known as T43 and they had a commander's cupola on top. R23 T-43  At the beginning of 1943 they were tested and turned out to be just a little better in combat than T34. R23 T-43  The decision was taken to start production, but after the battle of Kursk a few months later the it was obvious that a brand new heavy tank model was needed instead (it was to be IS-1) and thus the T43 project came to a close. R23 T-43 

By the middle of the war it had become clear that the Red Army needed a new medium tank. R23 T-43  The military demanded a tank with both maximum protection and minimum weight. R23 T-43  These demands were implemented and the new medium tank project was completed by June 1943 under the name of T-43. R23 T-43 
== Development ==
The T-43 had a configuration like the T-34 Medium Tank; its glacis consisted of 75 mm of armor and its turret-front was 90 mm. R23 T-43  The tank was armed with the 76. R23 T-43 2 mm F-34 Tank Gun. R23 T-43  However, the total length of the engine and transmission compartment was not reduced; therefore, the battle compartment remained very cramped. R23 T-43  To increase internal space, Soviet designers applied a torsion bar suspension that was more compact then the original Christie «candle» suspension. R23 T-43  It was the first time that a torsion bar suspension was used for medium tanks. R23 T-43 

Beginning in March 1943, two T-43 prototypes (preceded by vehicle T-43-1, which was built at the end of 1942. R23 T-43  It possessed a driver's vision hatch and had the commander's cupola displaced to the rear of the turret. R23 T-43 ) underwent trials. R23 T-43   These included combat trials with the NKSM Independent Tank Company. R23 T-43  These showed that the T-43, because of its increased 34. R23 T-43 1 ton weight, was marginally inferior to the T-34 in its ability to maneuver (maximum speed was decreased to 48 km/h). R23 T-43  It did, however, significantly surpass the latter in smoothness of ride. R23 T-43  The replacement of the eight side fuel tanks (on the T-34) for a smaller capacity fuel tank in the bow resulted in almost a 100km decrease in the radius of action. R23 T-43  Tank crews praised the crew compartment and greater ease in operating the armament. R23 T-43  After trials, the T-43 tank was recommended for acceptance by the Red Army at the end of the summer of 1943, but the results of the Battle of Kursk significantly altered this plan. R23 T-43 

The armor protection was superior, compared to the T-34, while its armament was similar to the KV-1S Heavy Tank. R23 T-43  However, the T-43 had a ground pressure similar to heavy tanks that adversely affected its range and maneuverability. R23 T-43   Even worse was its extreme construction: it didn't allow further modernization. R23 T-43  As a result, when production T-34's were rearmed with the 85 mm gun, the T-43 became obsolete. R23 T-43  However, experience with the T-43 was not lost. R23 T-43  The T-43's tests (3,000 km race) had clearly proved the superiority of the torsion bar suspension over the Christie's. R23 T-43

|HistAcc=
The T-43's actual main armament is the [[Gun/USSR#76 mm F-34|76 mm F-34]] gun. R23 T-43  All of the current gun configurations are fake. R23 T-43 
* The 85 mm D5T-85BM was only developed for the [[SU-85]]. R23 T-43  The weapon itself never entered service because of the appearance of the SU-100 project. R23 T-43 
* The 122 mm U-11 was actually designed for the T-34/76. R23 T-43  However, because the larger KV tank turret already struggled with insufficient comfort of service and rate of fire when armed with the howitzer, the proposal was rejected as "nonsensical". R23 T-43 
* The T-43 was cancelled in favour of the T-34-85. R23 T-43  In World of Tanks, however, the T-34-85 precedes the T-43. R23 T-43 
* Actual engine power is 500 hp. R23 T-43  All the other engine configurations are fake. R23 T-43 
* The V-54K engine was only fitted to the [[ISU-152]]K and [[T-54]]. R23 T-43
