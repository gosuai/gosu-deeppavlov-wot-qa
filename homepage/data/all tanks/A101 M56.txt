| The M56 Scorpion was planned to be the first American TD in the premium shop and tech tree. A101 M56  But instead is a special/bundle premium that has been for sale about once a month on the NA sever. A101 M56  However, it was later added to in-game shop in 9. A101 M56 22 patch. A101 M56 

It is the true glass cannon with only 1mm of armor. A101 M56  So take extreme caution to not get spotted, as you will be focused on immediately. A101 M56  The M56 can be very fun to play if played right as a sniper at the start of a battle and a close support tank towards the end. A101 M56  The gun is very good, if a little finicky at times, and can still pen quite a few tier 9s frontally when you aim for weak spots. A101 M56  Overall it can be a very fun vehicle once one gets the hang of it. A101 M56

|InTheGame_pros= 
- Very small size and great camo values

- Good accuracy, aim time and high penetration for tier 7 makes its shots very reliable

- Good gun depression and wide gun arc

- Great acceleration and can turn at near max speed. A101 M56 

- High penetration, both with AP and HEAT rounds

|InTheGame_cons= 
- Worst armor values in the game, HE shells and ramming are the bane of this vehicle and every hit will cause damage

- Disappointing damage per minute

- Mediocre top speed for a small TD with a medium sized gun and no armor

- Terrible gun traverse speed

- Bad as a crew trainer, as its crew slots and preferred skills/perks do not match higher-tier TDs' playstyle

Try to stay at extremely long range as a sniper at the start of the battle. A101 M56  Do not get spotted, because once you are, you'll be dead in seconds. A101 M56  Artillery loves you, so don't stay still for too long, and move immediately when spotted, because with that armor, any direct hit is a definite one shot kill, and even near misses can remove most of your health. A101 M56 

Extremely good penetration allows you to easily engage enemy heavy tanks, and the wide gun traverse arc allows you to cover large areas. A101 M56  However, gun traverse is extremely slow, and turning the hull may be needed to change targets on opposite sides of the battlefield. A101 M56  Fortunately, this tank has a surprisingly fast hull traverse, which might give it a bit of an advantage against an enemy light tank. A101 M56 

The very thin armor makes you extremely vulnerable to ramming. A101 M56  Along with the low weight, any contact with any tank, even a light touch by an [[ELC AMX|AMX ELC bis]] can be fatal. A101 M56  Also, as your armor is virtually non-existent, pretty much everybody is going to fire pure HE at you, which means your health will be drained very fast, along with the high chance of fire. A101 M56 

The compact module and crew arrangement will make multiple critical hits very likely, especially when hit by HE shells. A101 M56  Getting hit by HE shells is one of this tank's biggest drawbacks; not only will you take more damage, the chance of critical hits, especially multiple critical hits, is very very high. A101 M56  For example, one HE shell could take out half your health, destroy the engine and set fire to it, damage the ammo rack, kill the commander and break your left track. A101 M56  In this case, you're a sitting duck, unable to move and return fire due to both the engine and track getting destroyed, and unable to reload due to the ammo rack. A101 M56  You'll be an easy target, and even if nobody hits you a second time, the fire may easily burn you out, and in the event you do survive, your combat capability will be greatly diminished. A101 M56 

Towards the end of the battle you will want to move in closer but do not brawl. A101 M56  Find distracted enemy tanks to attack, and if you can't get to their sides, put that 219mm of pen to use. A101 M56  Also going hull-down will greatly improve your survivability, as the M56's gun shield is a very small target. A101 M56  Always pull back between reloads and stop every now-and-then when moving back up to try and trick your targets into firing. A101 M56  This is very useful to learn, as some maps just aren't suited for sniping. A101 M56  Always keep your gun in the game, whether through peek-a-booming, hull-down, sniping, or, in some cases flanking. A101 M56  Getting spotted is not as much of a problem as getting hit is. A101 M56  You will want to stay as a sniper when first getting this tank until you are used to its nature. A101 M56  Don't ever push, as that leads to a short-cut to the garage. A101 M56 

Sixth Sense is a must. A101 M56

|History= 
The M56 was manufactured from 1953 to 1959 by the Cadillac Motor Car Division of General Motors for use by US airborne forces, though the vehicle was eventually used by the Spanish Navy Marines, Morocco and the Republic of Korea as well. A101 M56  With a crew of four (commander, gunner, loader and driver), the M56 weighed 6. A101 M56 4t empty and 7. A101 M56 7t combat-loaded. A101 M56  It had infrared driving lights but no NBC protection system and was not amphibious. A101 M56 

The M56 was a fully Caterpillar tracked vehicle with rubber-tired run-flat road wheels and front drive sprocket wheels. A101 M56  It was powered by a Teledyne Continental Motors A01-403-5 gasoline engine developing 200 bhp at 3,000 rpm, allowing a maximum road speed of 28mph and a maximum range of 140mi. A101 M56  Twenty-nine rounds of main gun ammunition were carried, and only the blast shield was armored. A101 M56 

==In service==
The M56 saw combat service with U. A101 M56 S. A101 M56  forces in the Vietnam War. A101 M56  It was deployed with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, which was the only Airborne Brigade deployed with the M56, where it was used mainly in a direct fire-support role. A101 M56  Its function as an air portable, self-propelled, anti-tank vehicle was eventually replaced in Vietnam by the troubled but effective M551 Sheridan which had a fully armored turret. A101 M56  The USMC used the Ontos, which had an armored cabin and was armed with recoilless rifles, in a similar role (the running gear of the first Ontos prototype was the same as on the M56, but it was replaced for the production variant). A101 M56 

With the retirement of the Sheridan, current US airborne troops did not have a self-propelled gun system that could be delivered by air drop until the development of the M1128 Mobile Gun System Stryker MGS variant that is currently undergoing airdrop certification. A101 M56

Like other tanks that featured rubber tires, its ability to moving while its tracks is broken is missing. A101 M56
