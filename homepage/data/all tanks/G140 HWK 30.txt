Just like an Ru 251. G140 HWK 30  More or less a lighter version of Leopard Prototyp A that is designed for recon, keep moving with your amazing speed and maneuver when you can, but make sure not to turn around too much as this will slow you down a lot. G140 HWK 30  Avoid crashing into other tanks when at high speed as you'll lose a lot of health due to your light weight and thin armor. G140 HWK 30  Use your DPM and fire APCR or HEAT at enemies whenever you're not scouting. G140 HWK 30  If you're spotted, never stand still, as any shot that hits you will penetrate, or at best HE not penetrate for full damage. G140 HWK 30  Play it like a standard issue light tank with few - if any - downsides, but remember that it offers a lot more mobility and gun depression than most other lights, especially at this tier. G140 HWK 30
