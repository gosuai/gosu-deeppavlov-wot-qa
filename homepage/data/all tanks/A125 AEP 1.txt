|InTheGame_pros= 
- '''Unlimited Large Repair Kit''' consumeables; very useful especially when multiple modules of the tank is damaged. A125 AEP 1  Can save you a '''lot''' of money

- Decent agility and traverse speed (both on hull and turret)

- Good penetration for its tier, and also great gun depression

- Decently sloped upper plate, can deflect several incoming shot

- Insanely strong turret armor with relatively small cupola weakspot, coupled with great depression makes this tank very excel at hulldown position

|InTheGame_cons= 
- Overall poor hull armor (especially rear armor), still vulnerable when flanked

- Four sets of tracks are purely cosmetics; still getting demobilized when one of its tracks were damaged, and the gap between the pair of tracks negate its usability for sidescraping, as well as possible turret ring damage

- Slow rate of fire for its alpha; poor DPM

- Below average accuracy and long aim time

- Fairly large size; vulnerable against SPGs
