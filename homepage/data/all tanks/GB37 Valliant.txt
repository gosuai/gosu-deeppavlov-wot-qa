| In real life, the '''A38 Valiant''' were known as one of the worst tank to be ever designed due to several technical problems, the in-game Valiant, however, is essentially ''what-if'' version of the tank without its infamously terrible ergonomics. GB37 Valliant 

The Valiant is given for free to all players during the 5th stage of 10 years anniversary campaign. GB37 Valliant

- Tied with [[Tank:GB68_Matilda_Black_Prince|Matilda Black Prince]] and [[Tank:R32_Matilda_II_LL|Matilda IV]] for highest HP pool of all tier 5 mediums (800)

- Fast firing gun with enough penetration to penetrate most of poorly armored tanks

- Frontal armor is effective against most guns with sub-100mm penetration

- Side armor is surprisingly strong and can be used for sidescraping

- Relatively small profile and decent camoflage values

- 12. GB37 Valliant 5 degrees of depression, combined with the base turret front thickness and rounded "mantlet", very comfortable to play in a hulldown setup. GB37 Valliant 
|InTheGame_cons= 
- Second slowest tank in the game after [[Tank:GB63_TOG_II|TOG II]] (19km/h), will struggle to climb most slopes and hills

- Upper glacis, despite having a decent pike nose, can be easily penetrated by any guns with 120mm+ penetration

- Extremely thin roof armor (only 10mm at the engine deck and 20mm at the turret top), combined with its horrible mobility means it's extremely vulnerable against SPGs due to possibilities to get full damage by penetrating hits

- 91mm base penetration is still severely lacking against heavies at the same tier and some medium tanks

- '''No preferential matchmaking:''' had a chance to face a tier 7 opponents, all of which is equipped with a gun that can easily penetrate your tank while your gun is pretty much useless against them unless you're using gold ammo

- Weak ammorack located in the hull's shoulder and the upper side armor directly below the turret; expect to see this tank blow up semi-frequently. GB37 Valliant

On paper, the Valiant looks like an uparmored version of the [[Tank:GB04_Valentine|Valentine]], and similar to the [[Tank:GB68_Matilda_Black_Prince|Matilda Black Prince]] and [[Tank:R32_Matilda_II_LL|Matilda IV]] in terms of stats, with slightly better (but still mediocre) gun. GB37 Valliant  However, the tank suffers from a lot of severe drawbacks. GB37 Valliant  Firstly, courtesy to its bad armor layout, the 114mm part of hull armor only exists at the front of driver's hatch and lower glacis while the rest is only 60mm thick, which means this tank are heavily reliant on 50/50 RNG to block the shot. GB37 Valliant  The next thing is speed, the Valiant is currently the 2nd slowest tank in the game after the infamous [[Tank:GB63_TOG_II|TOG II]] while it doesn't have TOG's gigantic HP poor or the famed 17-pounder to compensate for its incredible vulnerability against SPGs . GB37 Valliant  On top of that, the Valiant has '''no''' preferential matchmaking, which means it can face a tier 7 opponents whose can easily beat you to death while you can do very little to no scratches on them at all unless you're using gold ammo. GB37 Valliant 

On the plus side, the Valiant is surprisingly effective against poorly armored medium tanks, as its armor and penetration is somewhat sufficient to protect itself and deal damage to the enemy. GB37 Valliant  This remain true as long as you have a support to cover your flank or not getting aimed by SPGs. GB37 Valliant

|History= 
'''The Tank, Infantry, Valiant (A38)''' was a British tank design of the Second World War that only reached the prototype stage. GB37 Valliant  Intended to meet the specification for a lightweight but heavily armoured tank for use in the war in the Far East, it proved to be a failure. GB37 Valliant  The sole example was retained by the School of Tank Technology after the war as a lesson to its students. GB37 Valliant 
===Design and development===
The Valiant, under General Staff specification A38, began as a candidate for an assault tank, with the thickest armour on the lowest possible weight, for use in the Far East. GB37 Valliant  It was to be similar in intention to the 40-ton A33 Excelsior although far lighter. GB37 Valliant  As the Valiant managed the same 114 mm frontal armour with only 27 tons, it managed to achieve its primary goal, but only by making unacceptable compromises elsewhere. GB37 Valliant  At a time when British tank design was already at its nadir, this "terrible price for the weight concession" led to what is probably the worst British tank of the war. GB37 Valliant 

The design brief of December 1943 called for three prototypes of a small, heavily armoured tank for the Far East. GB37 Valliant  Speed across open country was less important, as was performance against armour. GB37 Valliant  Design work started with Vickers, but they soon passed it to Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon, then finally Ruston & Hornsby, who built the single prototype in 1944. GB37 Valliant  Vickers' original intention may have been to use parts of their Valentine infantry tank where possible, but this did not survive the production choices of the other manufacturers, nor was the running gear of the far lighter Valentine compatible with the needs of such heavy armour. GB37 Valliant  The largest point of commonality was the choice of engine, the 210 bhp General Motors 6004 two-stroke diesel, as used in later marks of Valentine. GB37 Valliant 

Construction was like that of the Matilda infantry tank â€“ large cast armour pieces bolted together. GB37 Valliant  Suspension was by six equally sized wheels on each side, with independent wishbone suspension units for each, rather than bogies. GB37 Valliant  Concern was expressed about the possible fragility of these units in combat, but Valiant was never taken seriously off-road to test them. GB37 Valliant  The drivetrain was to the rear, from a 210 bhp diesel. GB37 Valliant  This low power limited the tank to a predicted top speed of 12 mph, although this was still acceptable to both the infantry tank and assault tank concepts. GB37 Valliant 

Following from the later Valentine VIII and XI models, the turret was to accept either the QF 6 pounder or the QF 75 mm, with space for a turret crew of three (commander, gunner, loader). GB37 Valliant  This was achieved at the cost of a large heavy turret with near-vertical faces and a massive cast front face with distinctively prominent bolts. GB37 Valliant  The mantlet was internal and a weak point against accurate fire at close range. GB37 Valliant  Unlike the late model Valentines it had a co-axial machine-gun. GB37 Valliant 

The Valiant's suspension was tested by the Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment (FVPE) at Chertsey in May 1945. GB37 Valliant  The first day gave minor problems and was abandoned after only 13 miles (21 km) of easy on-road driving. GB37 Valliant  However, the driver was already exhausted by this time, finding that the steering levers needed his full weight to operate and that the seat, footbrake and gear lever all carried risk of physical injury in using them. GB37 Valliant  The Officer in Charge decided to abandon the trials there and then as it was impossible and unsafe to continue, reporting that "in his view the entire project should be closed". GB37 Valliant  There were also issues with weight distribution and the ground clearance of only 9 inches, and by that point of the war there was no longer a need for the tank. GB37 Valliant  The Valiant project was terminated. GB37 Valliant 
===Variants===
A '''Valiant II''' was mentioned in late 1943, but little more was heard of it. GB37 Valliant  In February 1944 there was more detailed discussion of a "Heavy Valiant", which may have been the same and has been reported as such in some sources. GB37 Valliant 

The '''Heavy Valiant''' was a substantially different vehicle, only using the turret and driver's compartment of the Valiant on a hull derived from the A33 Excelsior and its T1 suspension. GB37 Valliant  This gave armour of 9 (hull front) and 10 inches (turret) thickness. GB37 Valliant  Weight was now estimated at 42 tons, which is comparable with the original Excelsior despite almost doubling the armour thickness, and so this must have been a much smaller tank. GB37 Valliant  Power was doubled to cope with the weight, using the new and compact 400 bhp Rolls Royce Meteorite engine (a cut-down V8 Meteor) and an improved transmission. GB37 Valliant  The mistake of the Valentine was to be repeated, where the turret was up-gunned to the 95mm howitzer of the Centaur IV at the cost of forcing the commander to take over the loader's task in a two-man turret. GB37 Valliant  There is a record of a prototype having gone to the ranges at Lulworth Cove for trials in January 1945, but no other record of what it looked like. GB37 Valliant 
===Present day===
The sole Valiant was retained by the School of Tank Technology, where students were treated to an inspection of it at the end of their course and invited to find fault. GB37 Valliant  David Fletcher wrote of this: "One hopes they started early in the morning. GB37 Valliant "

The Valiant can now be seen at The Tank Museum. GB37 Valliant
