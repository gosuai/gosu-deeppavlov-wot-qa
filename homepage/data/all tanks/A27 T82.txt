|InTheGame_pros= 
* Good damage per shot
* Relatively accurate gun 
* Small profile and high speed makes it easy to escape from side losses
* Quick reload, at least compared to its successor
|InTheGame_cons=
* Short range (covers barely half of the map without a particularly high arc)
* Long aiming time
* No stunning unlike its successor
* Absolutely no splash damage, if you miss you miss
* Lack of stunning and low caliber makes it pathetic against anything in tier 6
|InTheGame_performance=
The SPG can damage vehicles of its own tier effectively but struggles against anything higher. A27 T82  The splash isn't too impressive (read: next to nonexistent), but better than its counterparts such as the SU-26. A27 T82  If you have played the FV304 already, this SPG will feel very familiar. A27 T82  If you have played the Hummel instead. A27 T82 . A27 T82 . A27 T82  well, wait until tier 5. A27 T82
