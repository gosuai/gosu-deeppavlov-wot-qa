|InTheGame_pros=
*Excellent gun depression
*Turret has small profile and decent protection when in hull down positions
*Good damage with 5. J15 Chi Ni 7cm, good for taking out thin skinned armor like the Cruisers
*Very sloped frontal armor can bounce some shots at range
*Premium 5. J15 Chi Ni 7cm rounds are quite devastating with decent penetration
*Better than average Hit Points
*Reduced Chance of Engine Fire
*ROF on all guns is excellent
*The next tank is the Chi-Ha, which is a very good Tier 3 medium tank. J15 Chi Ni 

|InTheGame_cons=
*Inaccurate guns
*Mediocre mobility
*Average to Below average overall armor
*Poor Penetration on all guns

This is a solid support tank. J15 Chi Ni  While it is not the best at mobility, it can be sneaky with it's excellent gun depression over hills and ridges, where you should exploit this tank's strengths. J15 Chi Ni  The guns all have poor penetration and are quite inaccurate, but do fire fast. J15 Chi Ni  The 5. J15 Chi Ni 7cm gun is an excellent choice, as it's premium rounds have adequate penetration and even it's HE rounds can do a fair amount of damage to even the most armored of opponents. J15 Chi Ni  At 28mm of penetration, it is good at firing at flat, thin armor of the Cruiser tanks where it can devastate their vehicle. J15 Chi Ni 

This vehicle's armor is merely adequate. J15 Chi Ni  Frontal armor can bounce some low caliber shots at a long range and the upper plate is heavily sloped, however, it is only 10mm. J15 Chi Ni  Stay out of the line of fire, support your allies on the flanks. J15 Chi Ni

History and development

In 1935 news had reached Japan of the United Kingdom's development of an advanced new tank, the A6 medium tank. J15 Chi Ni  A multi-turreted design that mounted a 47 mm tank gun and was capable of reaching speeds of 50 km/h. J15 Chi Ni  In comparison, Japan's tank force had not undergone any significant changes in tactics or organization in six years. J15 Chi Ni  The country's most widely fielded medium tank, the Type 89 I-Go, while popular with troops and tank crews had begun to show its age, attempts to update the design with the Type 89B I-Go Otsu were made in 1934, but no fundamentally new design had been undertaken since. J15 Chi Ni  Until this point it was felt that there was no need for a new medium tank design. J15 Chi Ni  In comparison of the two tanks, the A6 was seen as having superior offensive and defence capabilities than its closest Japanese equivalent. J15 Chi Ni  The appearance of Britain's new tank design, along with reports from Manchuria of the Type 89 I-Go's inability to keep up with other motorized vehicles with its paltry 25 km/h top speed brought about plans for a replacement. J15 Chi Ni 

Tank designers recommended research on a new tank design, a medium tank capable of going 35 km/h and weighing 15 tons with offensive and defensive abilities greater than the Type 89 I-Go. J15 Chi Ni  The Chief-of-Staff Operations was not enthusiastic for the project as it was peace-time and the military had a limited budget to spend. J15 Chi Ni  The army thus issued peace time requirements for a new tank design. J15 Chi Ni  Rather than focusing on performance improvements, the Chief-of-Staff Operations made only a lighter weight the sole requirement in order to lower production costs. J15 Chi Ni  The finalised requirements were for a lightweight tank that was also capable of going 35 km/h. J15 Chi Ni  These requirement also led to the development of the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank. J15 Chi Ni  The Engineering Department believed that it was highly regrettable that their efforts would be devoted solely to weight reduction, so instead, two concurrent projects were built. J15 Chi Ni  The first plan was for a lower-weight, low-cost medium tank that was to be made by the Osaka Army Arsenal, which would become the Chi-Ni. J15 Chi Ni  The second plan was contracted to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for a higher performance medium tank design which would become the Chi-Ha. J15 Chi Ni
