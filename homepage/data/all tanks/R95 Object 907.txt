|InTheGame_pros=
- Extremely trollish armor layouts: this tank actually has V-shaped hull, which absorbs shot in corners of lower plate and most portions of the suspension; upper glacis is curved, with very thick weld seam on edges. R95 Object 907  Sides may able to bounce some shots when angled

- Very strong turret, also bouncy even from the sides; has strip of spaced armor protecting the turret ring and hull roof

- 3rd highest DPM among all mediums, also decent penetration and good gun handling

- Very strong side armor on the hull

- Decent all-around mobility and great agility

|InTheGame_cons=
- Poor alpha damage and below average depression on gun

- Turret roof is rather large, easily overmatched by mid-large calibre, and marked clearly by a line for easy targeting. R95 Object 907 

- Exceptionally vulnerable ammo rack due to weak module HP and tight internal emplacement

- Low ammunition count

'''History''' 

On 20. R95 Object 907 5. R95 Object 907 1952, Ministry of Defense industry of USSR organized a meeting with tank constructors and with the marshal of tank forces, I. R95 Object 907 S. R95 Object 907 Bogdanov, to discuss the future of armored forces development. R95 Object 907  The result of this meeting was a set of tank requirements from 18. R95 Object 907 6. R95 Object 907 1952. R95 Object 907  The resulting tank was to be better than T-54 - that was however no easy tasks and several teams (notably from plants no. R95 Object 907  75, 174, 183 and research institute no. R95 Object 907 100) were tasked to make a preliminary study. R95 Object 907  The design, produced by the research institute was designated "Object 907" and - as requested - its armor was significantly better than the one of the T-54. R95 Object 907  From 1954 to 1956 the metal prototypes of the hull and turret were manufactured in order to conduct armor tests and to find ways to improve the protection even more (see the T-22 medium history section for more details on the metal prototypes). R95 Object 907 


There two variants of the hull. R95 Object 907  The first hull was cast as whole, the second was welded from cast components. R95 Object 907  After the tests, the protection levels of the vehicle were found to be significantly higher than the ones of the T-54 (by as much as 30 percent). R95 Object 907  The turret was (thanks to its angles) as well protected as the one of the T-10 heavy tank. R95 Object 907 

The vehicle was to be equipped with the 100mm D-10T gun, but there was a plan to install even the 122mm M-62 gun. R95 Object 907  It was to be propelled by the 700hp B12-5 diesel engine with two transmission types: hydrodynamic (like in T-54) and mechanical (like in T-34). R95 Object 907 

The vehicle stayed in the semi-prototype phase, apparently because by the time it was introduced, the production of T-54 tanks was already underway. R95 Object 907
