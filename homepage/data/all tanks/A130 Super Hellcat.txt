| The '''Super Hellcat''' is gifted to all players with more than 5+ years of service record in 2019 "A Well-Deserved Reward" event. A130 Super Hellcat  

|Gallery= 

|InTheGame_pros= 

* Fastest Tier 7 in the game, 3rd quickest acceleration among Tier 7 TDs
* Good turret traverse and gun depression for a TD
* Good overall gun handling, well balanced between accuracy, aim time, and bloom control
* Crew layout matches several common mid tier American TDs

|InTheGame_cons= 
* Weak penetration values on both standard and premium rounds
* Lacking in DPM, small ammo reserve for its alpha damage
* Low health and thin armor, poor survivability
* Weak signal range due to bad radio, only average view range

The Super Hellcat is essentially a pre-nerf [[Hellcat]], with its mobility restored and moved up a tier. A130 Super Hellcat  While it still features its trademark speed and accuracy, being moved up a tier was not kind to the Super Hellcat. A130 Super Hellcat  The changes to the game's meta have not helped this machine either, and as a result a different set of tactics is required compared to what people thought the Hellcat used to be capable of. A130 Super Hellcat 

The most notable asset of the Super Hellcat is its speed. A130 Super Hellcat  It is, without exaggeration, the fastest tier 7 vehicle in the game, and can expect to actually reach its 72 kph top speed. A130 Super Hellcat  This speed allows it to reposition like no other tank destroyer can, and take advantage of positions that would normally only be available to light tanks. A130 Super Hellcat  It also makes it possible to flank, which is fortunate because it absolutely ''needs'' to attack enemies from their weak flanks. A130 Super Hellcat 

Unfortunately, this is due to the most notable weakness of the Super Hellcat: the terrible penetration values on the gun. A130 Super Hellcat  While not the worst standard ammunition of its class, its combination of low penetration and low rate of fire causes it to suffer from truly mediocre DPM, not at all helped by its miserly ammo supply of just 30 rounds. A130 Super Hellcat  The poor penetration values means that more of these shells will ricochet or simply not penetrate many tanks, especially the Tier 9s it can now expect to face. A130 Super Hellcat  This shortcoming hampers its APCR shell as well, which has an underwhelming 210mm of penetration. A130 Super Hellcat  Competitors such as the [[M56 Scorpion]] or even the non-premium [[T25/2]] can enjoy much higher penetration on both their AP and APCR shells, and therefore stand a chance of defeating the armor of tier 8 and 9 tanks where this tank would simply struggle in vain. A130 Super Hellcat  Therefore it is advisable to carry a good amount of HE shells along your AP(CR) ones. A130 Super Hellcat  

All together, the Super Hellcat is sadly quite inferior for its tier, even compared to the modern standard Hellcat. A130 Super Hellcat  While the Super Hellcat's raw stats are superior to the standard Hellcat, it can expect to see monsters such as the [[E-75]] or the [[Type 4 Heavy]] and is asked to fight them with shells that simply lack the penetration to affect many vehicles the Super Hellcat can expect to see. A130 Super Hellcat  Making the most of the vehicle requires heavy use of its two remaining good features--speed and camouflage. A130 Super Hellcat 

Find good locations to spot enemies while fishing for side shots. A130 Super Hellcat  Map awareness is crucial, as is practicing stealth sniping by either keeping two layers of concealment between yourself and the target or simply using your improved reverse speed to back away from concealment before firing. A130 Super Hellcat  Shoot drive wheels to disable enemies and sometimes cause damage, and consider focusing on enemy medium tanks instead of heavies. A130 Super Hellcat  Barring this, avoid well-armored heavy or superheavy tanks if at all possible. A130 Super Hellcat  You lack the penetration, alpha damage, or DPM to attack enemy heavies directly, so finding side shots or taking on lighter targets is crucial. A130 Super Hellcat

|History=
The 76 mm Gun Motor Carriage (GMC) M18 was an American tank destroyer of World War II. A130 Super Hellcat  The manufacturer, Buick, gave it the nickname "Hellcat" and it was the fastest tracked armored fighting vehicle during the war with a top speed up to 60 mph. A130 Super Hellcat [1] Hellcat crews took advantage of the vehicle's speed to protect against hits to its thin armor. A130 Super Hellcat  Many German Panther and Tiger tanks were destroyed because they could not turn their turrets fast enough to return fire. A130 Super Hellcat

In December 1941, the Ordnance Corps issued a requirement for the design of a fast tank destroyer using a Christie suspension, the Wright/Continental R-975 engine, and a 37 mm gun. A130 Super Hellcat 
In light of experience gained in North Africa, the 37 mm gun was found to be inadequate and the design was changed to use a British 57 mm gun. A130 Super Hellcat  During the development process, the design was further upgunned to a 75 mm gun, and then finally to the 76 mm gun. A130 Super Hellcat  The Christie suspension requirement was also dropped, and replaced with a torsion bar suspension. A130 Super Hellcat  The design was standardized in February 1943 and production began in July 1943. A130 Super Hellcat 
As a new design, the M18 incorporated several innovative maintenance features. A130 Super Hellcat  The Wright R-975 engine was mounted on steel rollers, which permitted it to be disconnected from the transmission, rolled out onto the lowered engine rear cover, serviced and then reconnected to the vehicle. A130 Super Hellcat  Similarly, the transmission could be removed and rolled out onto a front deck plate to allow inspection and repairs. A130 Super Hellcat 
The T70 prototype for the M18 first saw combat at Anzio, Italy, and production versions of the M18 were used in North-West Europe and Italy from the summer of 1944 onwards. A130 Super Hellcat 
In contrast to the M10 tank destroyer, which used the chassis of the M4 Sherman, the M18 Hellcat was designed from the start to be a fast tank destroyer. A130 Super Hellcat  As a result it was smaller, lighter, and significantly faster, but carried the same gun as the Sherman 76 mm models. A130 Super Hellcat  The M18 carried a five-man crew as well as 45 rounds of main gun ammunition, and an M2 Browning machine gun on a flexible ring mount for use against aircraft and infantry. A130 Super Hellcat 

The main disadvantages of the M18 were its very light armor, and the inconsistent performance of its 76 mm gun against the frontal armor of later German designs such as the Tiger and Panther. A130 Super Hellcat  The open-topped turret (a characteristic which it shared with the M10) left the crew exposed to snipers, grenades, and shell fragments. A130 Super Hellcat  The doctrinal priority of high speed at the cost of armor protection thus led to an unbalanced design. A130 Super Hellcat  The problem of the main gun performance was remedied with High Velocity Armor Piercing (HVAP) ammunition late in the war, which allowed the 76 mm gun to achieve greater frontal armor penetration, but this was never available in quantity. A130 Super Hellcat [[image:Early protoype T70. A130 Super Hellcat jpg|thumb|200px|left|Early protoype T70]]
While the M18 was capable of high road speeds this attribute was difficult to use successfully in combat, but along with the high top speed was a commensurate ability to accelerate rapidly and change direction rather quickly. A130 Super Hellcat  Although sustained travel at road speeds was hardly ever used outside of the Allied response during the Battle of the Bulge, most Hellcat crews found the higher speeds especially useful in a sprint to flank German tanks, which had relatively slow turret traverse speeds, and such maneuvering allowed the tank destroyer crew a shot instead into the enemy's thinner side or rear armor. A130 Super Hellcat  In general, Hellcat crews were complimentary of their vehicle's performance and capabilities, but did complain that the open top created a cold interior in the Northern European winter of 1944-45. A130 Super Hellcat  This problem was not helped by the fact that the air-cooled engine pulled a percentage of its cooling air through the crew compartment, creating in effect, a large armour plated refrigerator. A130 Super Hellcat  It was not designed to do so, but it proved impossible to seal off the crew compartment entirely from engine induced drafts. A130 Super Hellcat 

The only M18 variant which was produced in significant numbers was the M39 Armored Utility Vehicle, a turretless variation used to transport personnel or cargo or as a gun tractor. A130 Super Hellcat  This version was armed with a single M2 machine gun on a flexible mount. A130 Super Hellcat  650 early production M18s were converted into M39s by removing the turret and fitting seats for up to eight men in the open fighting space. A130 Super Hellcat  M39s saw combat during the Korean War, primarily as armored personnel carriers and munitions carriers, and were finally declared obsolete on February 14, 1957. A130 Super Hellcat  About 100 M39s were transferred to the West German Bundeswehr in 1956, where they were used to train the reestablished Panzergrenadier armored infantry units. A130 Super Hellcat  The M18 continued in production until October 1944, when the war was nearing its end. A130 Super Hellcat  2,507 had been produced by that time, at a unit cost of $57,500. A130 Super Hellcat  Though all tank destroyer units were disbanded by the U. A130 Super Hellcat S. A130 Super Hellcat  after the war, surplus M18s continued to see limited service.

== Combat Performance ==

A130 Super Hellcat jpg|thumb|200px|left|Company A, 637th TD Battalion at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides islands]]The M18 served primarily in Western Europe, but was also present in the Pacific. A130 Super Hellcat  Upon the American entry into the war in 1941, it had begun to supply China with AFVs including later the M18 Hellcats which along with M3 Stuarts, and M4 Shermans, trickled in through Burma and formed part of the several well-equipped, well-trained armies that the Chinese Nationalists could deploy. A130 Super Hellcat  These units were responsible for stopping numerous Japanese attacks during the later phases of the war. A130 Super Hellcat  However, due to the comparative rarity and poor quality of Japanese armor it was often used in a fire support role instead of as a tank destroyer. A130 Super Hellcat  On September 19, 1944, in the Nancy Bridgehead near Arracourt, France, the 704th Tank Destroyer Battalion was attached to the 4th Armored Division. A130 Super Hellcat  Lt. A130 Super Hellcat  Edwin Leiper led one M18 platoon of C Company to Rechicourt-la-Petite, on the way to Moncourt. A130 Super Hellcat  He saw a German tank gun muzzle appearing out of the fog 30 feet away, and deployed his platoon. A130 Super Hellcat  In a five minute period, five German tanks of the 113 Panzer Brigade were knocked out for the loss of one M18. A130 Super Hellcat  The platoon remained in their position and destroyed ten more German tanks, with the loss of another two M18s. A130 Super Hellcat  One of the platoon's M18s, commanded by Sgt Henry R. A130 Super Hellcat  Hartman, knocked out six of these and lived to fight another day. A130 Super Hellcat  Most of these knocked-out German tanks were Panthers. A130 Super Hellcat  The M18 Hellcat was a key element during World War II in the Battle of the Bulge. A130 Super Hellcat  On December 19–20, the 1st Battalion of the 506th PIR, was ordered to support Team Desobry, a battalion-sized tank-infantry task force of the 10th Armored Division (United States) assigned to defend Noville located north-northeast of both Foy and of Bastogne just 4. A130 Super Hellcat 36 miles (7 km) away. A130 Super Hellcat  With just four M18 tank destroyers of the 705th Tank Destroyer Battalion to assist, the paratroopers attacked units of the 2nd Panzer Division, whose mission was to proceed by secondary roads via Monaville (just northwest of Bastogne) to seize a key highway and capture, among other objectives, fuel dumps—for the lack of which the overall German counter-offensive faltered and failed. A130 Super Hellcat  Worried about the threat to its left flank in Bastogne, it organized a major joint arms attack to seize Noville. A130 Super Hellcat  Team Desobry's high speed highway journey to reach the blocking position is one of the few documented cases wherein the legendary top speed of the M18 Hellcat (55 miles per hour (89 km/h), faster than today's M1A2 Abrams) was actually used to get ahead of an enemy force as envisioned by its specifications.

The attack of 1st Battalion and the M18 Hellcat tank destroyers of the 705th TD Battalion near Noville together destroyed at least 30 German tanks and inflicted 500 to 1000 casualties on the attacking forces, in what amounted to a spoiling attack. A130 Super Hellcat  A Military Channel historian credited the M18 destroyers with 24 kills, including several Tiger tanks, and believes that in part, their ability to "shoot and scoot" at high speed and then reappear elsewhere on the battlefield and therefore appear to be another vehicle entirely played a large part in confusing and slowing the German attack, which subsequently stalled, leaving the Americans in possession of the town overnight. A130 Super Hellcat  The Hellcat, due to its 76mm gun, had major difficulty penetrating the glacis of Panther tanks. A130 Super Hellcat  Due to the almost absent armor of the Hellcat and its use of high flash powder the Hellcat made a relatively easy target for German tank crews. A130 Super Hellcat  Tank destroyers, in contrast to the pre-war doctrine governing their deployment, came to attack enemy armour from long range from an ambush position, acting in essence like self-propelled anti-tank guns. A130 Super Hellcat  The Hellcat had a gun that could penetrate roughly 88mm at 1000 m. A130 Super Hellcat  The average combat range noted by the Americans for tank vs. A130 Super Hellcat  tank action was around 800m to 900m. A130 Super Hellcat  This was just enough to penetrate a Panzer IV frontally, a tank designed in 1939. A130 Super Hellcat  If facing a Panther, a Hellcat would be facing a tank with roughly 140mm of line-of-sight armor frontally. A130 Super Hellcat  Hypothetically, if the Soviet Union decided to invade the rest of Europe during the war, the Hellcat would face the IS-2 with a glacis of roughly 200mm line of sight armor. A130 Super Hellcat 

== Tank Destroyer Doctrine ==
[[image:Irsch, Germany. A130 Super Hellcat jpg|thumb|200px|left|Irsch, Germany]]
American prewar armored doctrine was based on using tanks solely in a support and exploitation role, usually in conjunction with infantry. A130 Super Hellcat  Tank destroyers, such as the Hellcat, were to be used against tanks. A130 Super Hellcat  To this end the Hellcat was not intended to engage in protracted combat, and had light armor and extremely high speeds to quickly respond to breakthroughs in the line by German armor. A130 Super Hellcat  In reality, the opposite was true, as the attacks with the Sherman ran into defending German tanks far more often than intended. A130 Super Hellcat  In Italy, TDs compensated for a shortage of 155mm artillery ammunition by using their 3 inch or 76mm guns in indirect fire role. A130 Super Hellcat  Near the end of the war, there were so few German tanks that tank destroyers were increasingly used as self-propelled artillery in support of infantry for lack of any other targets. A130 Super Hellcat  The Hellcat was theoretically supposed to be used independently as a sort of mobile anti-tank gun, brought up from reserves to buffer an incoming armored thrust. A130 Super Hellcat  In practice a TD battalion was assigned nearly permanently to a division. A130 Super Hellcat  The doctrine of the time had Shermans acting in support of infantry to break enemy defenses, and then leading the attack with infantry in support during exploitation. A130 Super Hellcat  Prewar expectation was that all anti-tank work was supposed to be done by tank-destroyer crews, because attacking tanks could concentrate against a small part of a defending line. A130 Super Hellcat  Independent TDs groups were to counter concentrate, to stop enemy tanks from penetrating deeply. A130 Super Hellcat  Speed was essential in order to bring the Hellcats from the rear to destroy incoming tanks. A130 Super Hellcat  Obviously this would make it harder for an armored force to achieve a deep breakthrough, a main objective of armor, if the enemy had tanks. A130 Super Hellcat  It would also be easier for an opposing armored force to achieve a local breakthrough against an American tank battalion which would not have all of its anti-tank assets at the front during the beginning of any attack. A130 Super Hellcat  Thankfully, for Sherman crews, this doctrine was not entirely used as it would create a small window of time of weakness in the armored battalion until tank destroyers moved to the front. A130 Super Hellcat  TD battalions assigned to front line divisions often split up to companies attached to regiments, and platoons attached to infantry battalions. A130 Super Hellcat  When so attached, defending TD units supplemented organic antitank weapons (bazookas and 57mm towed guns). A130 Super Hellcat [[image:Okinawa on the Shuri Line in May 1945.

== Post War ==
After World War II, many M18s were given to other countries. A130 Super Hellcat  These were rebuilt and refurbished by Brown & Root in northern Italy in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and bear data plates that indicate those rebuilds. A130 Super Hellcat  One of the users was Yugoslavia, which kept them in reserve until the early 1990s. A130 Super Hellcat  A number of these vehicles were later used by the Military of Serbian Krajina and Army of Republika Srpska during the Yugoslav wars. A130 Super Hellcat  One example was used on an armored train named the Krajina Ekspres (Krajina Express). A130 Super Hellcat 
Taiwan also operated several M18s until their chassis and hulls were worn out, at which point the turrets were salvaged and installed onto surplus hulls of M42 Duster anti-aircraft vehicles to produce Type 64 light tanks. A130 Super Hellcat
