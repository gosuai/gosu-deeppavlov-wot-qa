|Compared to its predecessor, the [[AMX 50 100]], the AMX 50 120 is less mobile and significantly larger. F09 AMX 50 120  It reaches very high speeds downhill thanks to its high top speed, but the biggest difference is that the AMX 50 120 is that it's equipped with a 120mm cannon, hence its name. F09 AMX 50 120  This cannon concentrates its firepower into a 4-round drum and makes short work of tanks below the 50 120's tier. F09 AMX 50 120  As with all the high tier French heavy tanks, the 50 120 has weak armor, a long reload time, good mobility, and an excellent gun. F09 AMX 50 120  The 50 120 retains many of the features of the AMX 50 100 and is a natural evolution of its playstyle. F09 AMX 50 120

The AMX 50 120 can be a challenging Tier 9 to play, due to its huge size with abysmal armor and slow speed; however it is a feared and intimidating opponent, and with good reason. F09 AMX 50 120  
It wields tremendous firepower coupled with high mobility which enables it to relocate and support multiple flanks quickly, all the while enjoying an improved reload speed. F09 AMX 50 120  It excels as an opportunity sniper, quickly unloading into unfortunate enemies, and has very high potential in flanking. F09 AMX 50 120  The 4-round drum on the 120mm is a major advantage over the 6-round drum of the 100mm cannon mainly because it allows the AMX 50 120 to deal its potential 1600 damage much quicker and with better penetration. F09 AMX 50 120  A reloading 50 120 can intimidate enemies in a peek-a-boo situation by simply keeping its gun trained on them. F09 AMX 50 120  It's important to relocate to more advantageous and safer areas while reloading; don't sit around wasting time. F09 AMX 50 120  The 120mm gun is accurate, but not as accurate as one would expect at far distances. F09 AMX 50 120  Long-range shots tend to not go straight down the reticule. F09 AMX 50 120  Thus, the AMX 50 120 should take the time to carefully and fully aim each shot when necessary. F09 AMX 50 120  The 4-round drum also means that each shot counts much more and that a missed or bounced shot is a sorely wasted shot. F09 AMX 50 120  

Importantly, and even more so than the AMX 50 100, the AMX 50 120 must take caution in staying undetected and safe from arty. F09 AMX 50 120  While the 50 120 has around twice the side and rear armor as its predecessor, 80mm is still very poor. F09 AMX 50 120  Artillery at this tier can easily one-shot a full-health AMX 50 120 and will prioritize it as an easy kill. F09 AMX 50 120  A 50 120 shouldn't rush or scout nearly as much as he may have in the 50 100. F09 AMX 50 120  Very high caution must be taken as everyone hits very hard and the 50 120 is more vulnerable than ever, although the wonderfully shaped armor may auto-ricochet a lucky round or two. F09 AMX 50 120 

All in all, the AMX 50 120 is a natural evolution of the AMX 50 100's play-style, it's greatly enhanced in certain aspects. F09 AMX 50 120  A properly-played 50 120 provides its team with extreme firepower and invaluable support. F09 AMX 50 120  As with the 50 100, the AMX 50 120 holds tremendous potential and can greatly influence the tide of battle. F09 AMX 50 120

* You can also go first for the suspension, because you need it for the final gun, the 120mm SA46. F09 AMX 50 120  Suspension gives a further boost in mobility and gives you back the playstyle of the AMX 50 100

'''AMX 50 120'''

A third AMX 50 project was begun in August 1951. F09 AMX 50 120  Ten preseries vehicles were to be built by DEFA (Direction des Études et Fabrications d'Armement, the state weapon design bureau), the first being delivered in 1953. F09 AMX 50 120  The type was armed with a 120 mm gun in response to the perceived threat posed by the Soviet heavy tanks, such as the IS-3 and the T-10. F09 AMX 50 120  To accommodate the larger gun, an enormous turret was fitted; originally planned in a conventional form, eventually it was decided to make it of the oscillating type also. F09 AMX 50 120  Armour was increased. F09 AMX 50 120  These changes caused a weight increase to 59. F09 AMX 50 120 2 metric tonnes. F09 AMX 50 120  From 1954 to 1955 this type was made even heavier, creating the surblindé version ("AMX 50 Uparmoured") with a lower turret and a higher hull with a pointed glacis like the IS-3, bringing weight to about 64 tonnes. F09 AMX 50 120  

Based on the M 4 chassis in 1950 a prototype was finished of a heavy tank destroyer in the form of a 120 mm self-propelled gun, the Canon Automoteur AMX 50 Foch, named after Marshal Ferdinand Foch. F09 AMX 50 120  It was intended to give long range fire support to the medium AMX 50 "100 mm"; after the tank version itself was planned to be armed with a 120 mm gun, the Foch project was abandoned.

==AMX 50 Series development history==

'''Oscillating turret'''
[[image:Oscillating turret. F09 AMX 50 120 jpg|thumb|200px|left|Close up photo of a typical oscillating turret design]] 
Because there were five prototypes, it is not possible to give a description applying to all of them in detail. F09 AMX 50 120  Weighing about fifty-five tons, the general AMX 50 project was the heaviest of a trio of French AFV designs of the postwar period (the others being the AMX-13 and the Panhard EBR) to feature an oscillating turret. F09 AMX 50 120  The oscillating turret design, lacking a conventional gun-mantlet, is in two separate parts, with an upper and lower part connected by two hinge bolts or pivots, the gun being fixed within the upper section. F09 AMX 50 120  The horizontal movement of the gun, traversing, is conventional, but the vertical movement, elevation, is achieved through the pivoting of the entire upper section with respect to the lower section. F09 AMX 50 120  This method of elevation has two main advantages. F09 AMX 50 120  Firstly it allows for a smaller turret volume, as no internal space is needed for the vertical movement of the gun breech. F09 AMX 50 120  Secondly, it allows the use of a relatively simple auto-loader fed by multiround magazines, achieving a very high rate of fire for as long as the magazines were loaded, as the gun is also fixed with respect to the auto-loader located in the back of the upper turret, i. F09 AMX 50 120 c. F09 AMX 50 120  a protruding bustle. F09 AMX 50 120  The automatic loading system worked satisfactorily when the calibre was 100 mm. F09 AMX 50 120  After the larger 120 mm gun was introduced, reliability suffered, due to the increased weight of the rounds used. F09 AMX 50 120  The oscillating turret was a very fashionable concept in the fifties, and also applied in some American projects, such as the T57 and T58. F09 AMX 50 120  Only the French however, would produce operational systems. F09 AMX 50 120 

'''German rolemodels'''

The hull was equipped with a torsion bar suspension designed to ensure a vehicle with good cross-country mobility. F09 AMX 50 120  The hull and suspension recalled both the German Tiger and the Panther tanks which, having entered French service after the war, were well known and deliberately imitated. F09 AMX 50 120  Especially the engine deck, the sprockets and the tracks are strongly reminiscent of the German design style. F09 AMX 50 120  The nine overlapping tyred road wheels each side, were however much smaller. F09 AMX 50 120  The French engineers had not been aware at first that the much admired German overlapping design had been motivated by a shortage of high quality rubber, necessitating large road wheels to lower tyre tension, which then were made overlapping to better distribute the load pressure. F09 AMX 50 120  As France would have no trouble obtaining rubber of the desired quality, this feature was superfluous. F09 AMX 50 120  Therefore the road wheels were made smaller, compared to the first design proposal, both to save weight and lower the profile of the tank, which was quite high due to a deep hull, a problem only changed in the fifth prototype. F09 AMX 50 120  The track now had to be supported by five top rollers. F09 AMX 50 120  The overlapping system as such was maintained in all prototypes; with smaller wheels it allowed for nine instead of the originally planned eight wheels, five forming the outer, four the inner row. F09 AMX 50 120 

[[image:AMX 50 100 during trials. F09 AMX 50 120 jpg|thumb|200px|right|AMX 50 100 during trials. F09 AMX 50 120  First of the AMX 50 protoypes is easily recognisable by an oscillating turret and a Panther like sloped front plate]] The engine and transmission system was in the rear of the vehicle with rear drive sprockets. F09 AMX 50 120  The transmission was derived from the ZF of the Panther. F09 AMX 50 120  The functions of final drive and steering were combined in a single assembly; for each gear two turning radii could be selected. F09 AMX 50 120  The engine was the Maybach HL295 12 cylinder of 29. F09 AMX 50 120 5 litres, using fuel injection combined with spark ignition. F09 AMX 50 120  The project goal was to bring the engine output to 1200 hp, implying a very favourable hp/litre ratio of over forty. F09 AMX 50 120  This proved to be unrealistically ambitious, given the level of technological development at the time; in reality not even a ratio of thirty was reliably attained. F09 AMX 50 120 

The hull sides were vertical, as in the case of the Tiger, while the front of the hull was in the first three prototypes evenly inclined at approximately 40 degrees from the horizontal, using sloped armour similar to that of the Panther and Tiger II. F09 AMX 50 120  The corners between the glacis and the sides were truncated. F09 AMX 50 120  The first two prototypes had a frontal protection level equivalent to about 120 mm "line-of-sight" thickness in the horizontal plane. F09 AMX 50 120  The type was thus not particularly heavily armoured for its time. F09 AMX 50 120  The weight increase with the third prototype was mainly caused by the larger turret and even in its fourth "uparmoured" form, doubling the frontal armour thickness, the AMX 50 was less well protected than its American and British competitors, themselves inferior in armour to the Soviet heavy tanks they had been created to fight. F09 AMX 50 120  The fifth prototype used a lower cast hull, with a rounded frontal section for a better weight efficiency. F09 AMX 50 120 

Above the massive hull, there was the oscillating turret, smaller, lighter and more compact than that of the Tiger; the sloped face of the upper part had a thickness of 85 mm. F09 AMX 50 120  In the turret rear back there was the commander's cupola, well equipped with optical equipment. F09 AMX 50 120  The turret had an optical rangefinder. F09 AMX 50 120  The first two prototypes had twin 7. F09 AMX 50 120 5 mm "Reibel" machine guns placed on top of the roof as an AA-weapon, a third was coaxial. F09 AMX 50 120  In the first design proposal for a 120 mm version, the conventional turret had a high cupola armed with both a machine gun and a 20 mm MG 151 rapid fire cannon. F09 AMX 50 120  However the third and fourth "120 mm" oscillating turret prototypes had a single 7. F09 AMX 50 120 5 mm AA machine gun and a second 7. F09 AMX 50 120 5 mm coaxial machine gun. F09 AMX 50 120  For the production vehicles it was considered to install a coaxial 20 mm gun; lighter armoured targets could then be engaged without depleting the limited ammunition stock in the turret magazines. F09 AMX 50 120  Despite the auto-loader, the crew was four: a second man was seated in the hull, functioning as radio-operator, but mainly needed to replenish the turret magazines from the hull ammunition stocks. F09 AMX 50 120 

'''Jack of all trades wannabe'''

The AMX 50 as originally planned, would have been a medium, not a heavy, tank. F09 AMX 50 120  It was supposed to be light, well armed and above all mobile. F09 AMX 50 120  When the first two prototypes were made, low weight had already been sacrificed in favour of a high protection level, but it was still supposed to be a quite agile vehicle, in the 45 - 50 tonne weight class, with a hp/tonne ratio of over twenty. F09 AMX 50 120  Expectations were high: as General Molinié afterwards ironically put it, it was hoped to create a tank with the protection of the Panther, the firepower of the Tiger, the mobility and abundance of the T-34, the reliability of the M4 Sherman and all that weighing less than the M26 Pershing. F09 AMX 50 120  At that time France hoped to regain its position as a Great Power; rebuilding its armaments industry served this goal. F09 AMX 50 120  To build an indigenous battle tank was however not merely a question of national prestige. F09 AMX 50 120  Europe as a whole was trying to recover from the devastations caused by the war and to assert a modicum of independence towards the two superpowers, the USA and the USSR. F09 AMX 50 120  To this end in 1948 the Treaty of Brussels was signed, which among other things was also a common defence agreement. F09 AMX 50 120  The AMX 50, superior in armament and mobility to the existing American and British designs, was seen as the logical candidate for a common European tank, to equip the future armies of the Western European Union defence organisation. F09 AMX 50 120  The prototypes were proudly displayed during the 1950 Bastille Day parade. F09 AMX 50 120  Somewhat inconsequentially, it was hoped that the Americans would fund such a tank, as the financial position of the European states would not allow them to rearm. F09 AMX 50 120 

[[image:AMX 50B 120 rear view. F09 AMX 50 120 jpg|thumb|200px|right|AMX 50B 120 rear view]]That same year, the situation changed drastically due to the outbreak of the Korean War. F09 AMX 50 120  Quickly the USA recommenced medium tank mass production, of the new M47 Patton. F09 AMX 50 120  When this tank proved to be unsatisfactory, an even more advanced type was taken into production for the American forces, the M48 Patton; thousands of M47s were leased for free to the European allies, France included. F09 AMX 50 120  The AMX 50 was suddenly made redundant as a medium tank, despite a "100 mm" prototype being sent in 1952 to the Aberdeen Proving Grounds for, successful, tests. F09 AMX 50 120 

'''Engine problems'''

To save the project, a new rôle was found in the Soviet heavy tank threat. F09 AMX 50 120  In the early fifties, NATO tacticians were worried by the strong armour of the Soviet vehicles, that seemed to be immune to the guns of the existing Western types. F09 AMX 50 120  In response Britain would develop the Conqueror and the USA the M103 heavy tank; abandoning the SOMUA SM, it was decided to let the AMX 50 evolve into a comparable type, even though other French heavy tank projects were in existence, such as the Char de 70 tonnes, a sort of "AMX 70". F09 AMX 50 120  Already having a large chassis, the AMX 50 could in principle easily be adapted to carry the desired 120 mm gun — a derivation by the Atelier du Havre of the American gun, using the same ammunition — and had the advantage of a, on paper, very powerful engine. F09 AMX 50 120  In practice there were many obstacles. F09 AMX 50 120  Room could in fact only be found by increasing the height of the lower turret half, negating the advantages of the oscillating concept and creating a dangerous shot trap. F09 AMX 50 120  The "uparmoured" version, with its deeper hull and flatter turret, was specially designed to counter this and make the vehicle immune in long range fire engagements, but further increased weight. F09 AMX 50 120  In 1955 the AMX 50 was nevertheless very close to being ordered by the French government, that expected to produce the type for the reconstituted German Army also. F09 AMX 50 120  A production was planned of a hundred for 1956. F09 AMX 50 120  This decision had to be delayed however, due to the fact the engine problems had not been solved: reliability could only be assured if the output was limited to 850 hp, causing a mediocre hp/tonne ratio of about 13:1. F09 AMX 50 120 

'''Delayes proved fatal '''
[[image:Seventy-ton version of the AMX 50 battle tank with a 120 mm gun. F09 AMX 50 120 . F09 AMX 50 120 jpg|thumb|200px|left|Seventy-ton version of the AMX 50 battle tank with a 120 mm gun and a frontal armor of 120 mm]]
The delay proved fatal to the project. F09 AMX 50 120  In the late fifties, swift advances in hollow charge technology led to an increased vulnerability for heavy tanks. F09 AMX 50 120  Mobility thus gained a priority over protection and the very concept of a heavy tank became obsolete. F09 AMX 50 120  As a result the project was changed again in intention, now trying to present itself as an agile main battle tank, with the same gun as the Conqueror but much lighter and more powerful. F09 AMX 50 120  This failed as it was much too large and expensive; oscillating turrets also became unpopular as they were inherently difficult to protect against nuclear and chemical contamination. F09 AMX 50 120  The engine problems with the Maybach were never overcome and lowering the hull to save weight, as was done for the final prototype, made it impossible to install a larger engine. F09 AMX 50 120  Recognizing that the problem of combining excellent mobility with heavy armour was for the time being irresolvable, the AMX 50 project was terminated; the priority given to mobility demanded a new design concept, leading to the AMX 30, the lightest MBT of its time. F09 AMX 50 120  Only in the early eighties would France again attempt to combine heavy armour and armament in its tank designs, beginning with the later AMX 32 prototypes. F09 AMX 50 120  The AMX 50 would not be a complete waste of time and effort however, as much technological knowledge had been gained from which the AMX 30 would profit. F09 AMX 50 120  In the Musée des Blindés at Saumur an AMX 50 is shown, a combination of the last cast hull and the Tourelle D. F09 AMX 50 120

The current AMX 50 120 is a hybrid between three different AMX designs - it uses a turret based on the first AMX 50 120, the hull and flanks of the seventy-ton AMX 50 120, and the nose, engine, and suspension of the AMX 65t. F09 AMX 50 120 
* The top speed of the AMX 50 120 was much slower than 65 kph - it used the same engines as the AMX 50 100 while weighing more, and the AMX 50 100 had a top speed of only 51 kph. F09 AMX 50 120
