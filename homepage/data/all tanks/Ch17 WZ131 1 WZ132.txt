* Still worse power-to-weight ratio than peers post-9. Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132 18

A bit smaller, faster and stronger than its predecessor, the WZ-132 is sort of a medium tank among light tanks, combining firepower, agility and mobility.

Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132  It is suitable for all kinds of combat roles including long range combat (good accuracy and aim time), brawl (small profile and agility) and scouting - passive (great camo value and view range) and active (great speed and traverse).

While it doesn't have a drum loader, the WZ-132 has a few benefits as a combat vehicle compared to the Bat. Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132 -Chat. Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132  12t.

Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132  The tank has sloped frontal armor and turret, which occasionally bounces enemy shells. Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132  However, the Bat. Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132 -Chat.

The WZ-132 has a great choice of guns. Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132  You can either play with the more accurate 85 mm 64-85T or the more damage-oriented 100 mm 60-100TA. Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132  Should you select the 85mm gun, your tank will be more accurate and have a substantially better rate of fire (although DPM will only increase marginally). Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132  Should you select the 100mm gun, you will have higher alpha, and can use APCR instead of HEAT.

Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132  You will be able to fire accurately while you stay at a distance (~50-100m) and keep moving when in an open area. Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132  When you do this, your opponent will often miss their shots. Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132  Once their drum has been depleted, the WZ can easily kill it during its much longer reload time. Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132  Should most other tanks try to turn in a long curve, the WZ's superior agility will let it close the distance very fast. Ch17 WZ131 1 WZ132
