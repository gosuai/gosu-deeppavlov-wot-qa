|It comes with a 4 round [[Automatic Loader|autoloader]]. F17 AMX 13 90  

As with the the AMX 13 75, it works best waiting for engagements to occur and then flanking the enemies, firing on their sides and rear rapidly, and then fleeing to reload. F17 AMX 13 90  It is also fairly good at scouting and artillery killing, although it doesn't accelerate as fast as some other lights, so it should avoid stopping or slowing down when performing these roles.

Coupled with the right mindset and determination, the 13 90 can be either a rewarding tank to play, or extremely frustrating. F17 AMX 13 90  The first thing to understand about the 13 90 is that the gun doesn't make it a medium tank, and playing it as one will bring a quick death. F17 AMX 13 90  Despite having an auto loader, the 13 90 is not a good flanker, it has the worst on the move gun handling. F17 AMX 13 90 

The key to survival in the 13 90 is camouflage. F17 AMX 13 90  Almost all of your time should be spent either running or behind a bush. F17 AMX 13 90  The AMX 13 90 should strive to keep his autoloader in the fight without attracting enemy attention, as taking any fire will quickly result in a death. F17 AMX 13 90  The only time the 13 90 should be the enemy's primary target is when he is able to quickly finish off any enemy shooting at him and able to quickly get back into cover. F17 AMX 13 90 

The AMX 13 90 has very poor gun depression and elevation. F17 AMX 13 90  Terrain bumps and dips should be used to angle your hull up and down to allow shots that couldn't normally be made. F17 AMX 13 90 

|InTheGame_research=
* The SCR-528F radio carry over from earlier vehicles, mount it immediatly. F17 AMX 13 90 
* Then upgrade the gun to the 90mm F3 for a much needed increase in burst damage total and penetration. F17 AMX 13 90 
* The suspension should be researched next. F17 AMX 13 90  The suspension not only increases the load capacity and the traverse speed, but also improves the terrain resistances and gun handling of the vehicle. F17 AMX 13 90 
* Final engine - allowing you to get up to speed and flex better around the battlefield. F17 AMX 13 90
