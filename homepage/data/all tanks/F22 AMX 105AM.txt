|InTheGame_performance=
* When you first start this tank you might miss a lot of shots, but give it time and train your crew as the accuracy is actually very good compared to other tier 5 arty. F22 AMX 105AM  The second gun has higher accuracy than the stock gun. F22 AMX 105AM 

* This tank's decent top speed allows you to re-position very quickly and avoid enemy scouts or slower heavy tanks. F22 AMX 105AM  It has fairly low acceleration and it slows down a bit on hills, so be careful if you like trying to find odd areas to shoot. F22 AMX 105AM 

* This tank plays like a TD a lot of the time, due to the low shell arch. F22 AMX 105AM  It also is a TD on steroids because it can hit across the map. F22 AMX 105AM  So a TD with benefits. F22 AMX 105AM  So aim behind enemy tanks to get the most accuracy out of the gun. F22 AMX 105AM
