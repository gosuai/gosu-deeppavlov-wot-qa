|InTheGame_pros= 
- Respectable armor from all sides, same values as Tiger I

- Great top speed of 40 kph

|InTheGame_cons= 
- No premium matchmaking, can and will see tier 8 tanks

- 145mm of AP penetration is still somewhat lacking - struggles when bottom tier

- Vulnerable ammo rack and engine, fairly flat armor is easy to penetrate

- Very slow shell velocity and somewhat poor dispersion values

- Weak turret roof armor, only 25mm thick

- One less crewmember that the other Japanese heavies, limits its usefullness as a crewtrainer

Large, tough, and surprisingly effective, the Heavy Tank No. J19 Tiger I Jpn  VI plays similarly to the [[Tank:G15_VK3601H|VK 36. J19 Tiger I Jpn 01 (H)]]. J19 Tiger I Jpn  Make no mistake, this tank is not anywhere near as potent as the higher-tier German [[Tank:G04_PzVI_Tiger_I|Tiger I]] - it has significantly less HP, penetration and accuracy - although its armor values are very similar which allows for some effective side scraping at medium ranges. J19 Tiger I Jpn  As of 9. J19 Tiger I Jpn 15, the penetration of the gun has been improved to 145mm (from a paltry 132) which in turn allows this tank to be more competitive in higher-tier games. J19 Tiger I Jpn  Overall, this is a decent and inexpensive premium that's main appeal lays in it being a premium, non-German Tiger I - at tier VI!

The Heavy Tank No. J19 Tiger I Jpn  VI's role depends on its placement in the matchmaking. J19 Tiger I Jpn  
* When top tier, it is a powerful bully: angling its armor allows it to bounce most lower tier guns with its front hull and its 145mm of penetration, alongside the base 220 damage, means that it can quickly decimate lesser foes. J19 Tiger I Jpn  The HT No. J19 Tiger I Jpn  VI can reliably expect to two-shot tier 5 mediums and 3-shot tier 6 mediums or tier 5 heavies. J19 Tiger I Jpn 
* When mid-tier, it is a reliable supporter: its armor is less useful against tier 7 opponents and it will start facing enemies that will quickly dismiss its 145 stock penetration. J19 Tiger I Jpn  What they cannot afford to ignore is its high rate of fire, which allows it to continue harassing opponents with medium ranged hits. J19 Tiger I Jpn 
* When bottom tier, it is an opportunistic flanker: the armor is of little use at tier 8, and the accuracy and penetration are simply inadequate for head-on fighting. J19 Tiger I Jpn  As a result, it must use its remaining two features, good rate of fire and surprising speed, to skirt the edges of battle and act like a large medium. J19 Tiger I Jpn 

The HT No. J19 Tiger I Jpn  VI has fairly average DPM, but benefits greatly from additional equipment. J19 Tiger I Jpn  Between a 100% crew and the installation of both Gun Rammer and Improved Vents, it can boast a DPM of over 2200 thanks to a 10. J19 Tiger I Jpn 16 rate of fire, shaving the reload on its 88mm gun down to just under 6 seconds. J19 Tiger I Jpn  Given the very healthy 92 round supply of ammunition, this is one tank that is unlikely to run dry at an inopportune moment. J19 Tiger I Jpn  It also means that it is not unreasonable to take speculative shots--you have the ammo to spare. J19 Tiger I Jpn  The High Explosive shell is unusually underwhelming for a gun of this caliber and is best used only against very soft targets. J19 Tiger I Jpn  The APCR shell's 194mm of penetration makes it a viable choice against tier 7 and 8 opponents, and the sheer amount of ammunition on board means that players can carry a large amount of APCR if desired without compromising on their supply of standard AP shells. J19 Tiger I Jpn 

The HT No. J19 Tiger I Jpn  VI shares many weak spots with the Tiger I, most notably a very vulnerable lower glacis. J19 Tiger I Jpn  Expect engine damage or fires if your lower plate is targeted. J19 Tiger I Jpn  The large 'trashcan' cupola is also a fairly obvious target and will attract a lot of enemy fire, as will the ammo stowage on the sides of the tank. J19 Tiger I Jpn  If you have to peek around corners, try to force the engagement such that you can fire around left turns, as this will help hide the cupola. J19 Tiger I Jpn 

Notably, this tank has the standard five arrangement of crew where most of the Japanese heavy line have six crew members, with either two radio operators or two loaders. J19 Tiger I Jpn  In order to use this tank as a crew trainer you will need to swap out crew members in order to train the full complement. J19 Tiger I Jpn

(See the [[Tiger I]] page for the history of the Tiger I in general)


In 1943, Japan requested their embassy in Germany to inspect new tanks Germany had been working on. J19 Tiger I Jpn  The man assigned to lead this team was General Hiroshi Oshima. J19 Tiger I Jpn  In 1943, Hiroshi spent a large portion of time conducting tests and personal trials in Siverskaya (Leningrad Oblast) with the 502nd Heavy Panzer Battalion. J19 Tiger I Jpn  While there he and his team were able to get a firm grasp on the Panzer VI Tiger’s capabilities. J19 Tiger I Jpn  To Hiroshi’s standards, the vehicle preformed outstandingly and wanted it to be purchased for use. J19 Tiger I Jpn 

Payment of the Tiger tank was confirmed by Henschel on February 28th, 1944. J19 Tiger I Jpn  After the purchase was made, the Army spent time analyzing the Tiger’s role in service. J19 Tiger I Jpn  This caused a problem with the higher ups as its use was very limited. J19 Tiger I Jpn  The tank could not be manufactured with the material quota, and with the war situation finding new methods for it specifically was not an option. J19 Tiger I Jpn  No plans for transporting the Tiger were made, and in the meantime the Tiger was left in the hands of the 101st Heavy Panzer Battalion while stationed in Belgium. J19 Tiger I Jpn  The events of the Tiger after is unknown, but most likely used during the Allied invasion. J19 Tiger I Jpn
