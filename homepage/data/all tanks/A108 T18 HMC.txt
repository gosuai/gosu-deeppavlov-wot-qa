|InTheGame_pros=
 *Has 50mm of frontal armor, which can bounce same-Tier shots
 *Very good reload
 *Due to it's great frontal armor and reload time, TD mode is definitely possible

|InTheGame_cons= 
* Armor will not stand up to Tier V's (but it no longer has to face them)
* Has almost no splash damage, hitting near an enemy will do minor damage
* Gun cannot compete with Tier V heavies, even with HEAT loaded (but it no longer has to face Tier V's)

Originally part of the American tank destroyer line, the T18 quickly became a favorite, owing to the combination of excellent armor and a powerful gun that could one-shot kill any tank of the same tier or lower. A108 T18 HMC   As artillery it can still work well as long as it is top tier, having excellent mobility and relatively strong armor. A108 T18 HMC   It also has a good rate of fire and relatively good accuracy for its tier, which makes it relatively easy to play for inexperienced artillery players. A108 T18 HMC   Its main drawback is the very low alpha damage, which renders it largely useless in Tier V games due to its inability to damage heavy tanks (but Tier III's no longer have to face Tier V's). A108 T18 HMC   In lower tier games this is not a problem thanks to the lack of heavily armored vehicles. A108 T18 HMC

The T18 Howitzer Motor Carriage was an American self-propelled gun. A108 T18 HMC   Its development started in September 1941 as a close-support vehicle using the M3 Stuart's chassis. A108 T18 HMC   A 75mm howitzer was mounted on the right front of the vehicle. A108 T18 HMC   The gun mount was adapted from the M3 Grant. A108 T18 HMC   Two prototypes were produced by Firestone and then sent to the Aberdeen Proving Ground. A108 T18 HMC   However they were unsatisfactory because of their high superstructure and nose weight. A108 T18 HMC   Because the Army disliked the high superstructure and nearly vertical armor, the T18 was abandoned in 1942, and soon started a new turreted project, the T41 75mm HMC, also known as the Howitzer Motor Carriage M8.
