With the 12,8 cm this tank destroyer is a long-range sniper and, because of your armor and less than stellar mobility, you want to keep it at long range because once you are spotted, you are dead. G99 RhB Waffentrager  Before 9. G99 RhB Waffentrager 2 this tank had the best DPM of all German tier VIII TD's and even after the nerf that came with that update it still has that position (although the RoF was reduced to 5,22) so if you keep at range your amazing damage and penetration will soon destroy the competition.

With the 15 cm your playstyle changes to a short-range brawler/ambusher, taking pot-shots at the enemy at ranges where they will be able to see you and you will have to aim for weakspots in the enemy armor because of your lower penetration.
