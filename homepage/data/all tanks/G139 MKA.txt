The Kampfwagen für Ausland mit verstärkter Panzerung, 4,5cm K L/50 und 2 MG also known as mittlerer Kampfwagen für Ausland (abbreviated as m. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA ), was a German tank project that intended to create a medium tank for export. G139 MKA  The vehicle was planned to be better than other vehicles that were available at the time, such as the Renault R35 or Vickers 6-ton Tank. G139 MKA  

 Development 

On 5 October 1936, the mittlerer Kampfwagen für Ausland (mKA) was mentioned in a meeting in Essen with Müller and Wölfert. G139 MKA  The leichte Kampfwagen für Ausland (l. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA ) would be developed to attempt to mount a 2cm gun and an MG in the same turret. G139 MKA  The m. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  was to be an off-shoot of the l. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  

In a Kriegsmaterial Abteilung fiscal year report dated 1 October 1936 to 30 September 1937, Krupp stated that development had started on Auslands-Kampfwagen (tanks for foreign sale). G139 MKA  These vehicles were to be lighter than vehicles developed for the German Army, as weight was considered an issue with exporting vehicles. G139 MKA  

By 5 February 1937, Krupp changed their plans for the Auslands-Kampfwagen. G139 MKA  The following vehicles were planned; 
1. G139 MKA  l. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  1: a 4. G139 MKA 5t light tank with two machine guns, named M. G139 MKA G. G139 MKA  K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  
2. G139 MKA  l. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  2: a 5. G139 MKA 2t light tank with a 2cm cannon and one machine gun, named 2cm K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  
3. G139 MKA  A variant of the l. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  2 with thicker armour, weighing 7t. G139 MKA  Named 2cm K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA v. G139 MKA  
4. G139 MKA  m. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA : a 7t medium tank, armed with a 4,5cm Kanone and two machine guns, named 4,5cm K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  
5. G139 MKA  A variant of the m. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  with thicker armour, weighing 10t. G139 MKA  Named 4,5cm K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA v. G139 MKA  
6. G139 MKA  s. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA : a heavy tank weighting 14t, armed with a 7,5cm Kanone and two machine guns. G139 MKA  Named 7,5cm K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  

Each two vehicles were planned to share the same chassis. G139 MKA  Stronger engines were considered if needed, a 90hp water-cooled Ford V8 was available for the l. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA , with a water-cooled Maybach engine for the m. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  The engine for the s. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  was not chosen. G139 MKA  

Armament discussions regarding the 4,5cm and 7,5cm Kanone resulted in the proposal for their muzzle velocity to be about 500m/s, the reasoning behind this was that combat ranges would rarely be over 1000m, and sufficient penetration can be expected from such a velocity within said range. G139 MKA  Single-shot weaponry was also considered, due to the shortage of space inside the turret. G139 MKA  

The meeting also discussed the proposed deadlines. G139 MKA  The design work of the vehicle was to be completed by December 1937, and a test vehicle completed by June 1938. G139 MKA  There was a 180/200HP Maybach engine that was being considered, however the Waffenamt hadn't released information about it at the time. G139 MKA  Another meeting was to be held in October to discuss the future of the K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA v. G139 MKA  and the s. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  and whether they are to be built. G139 MKA  Sketches were to be completed by 1 July 1937. G139 MKA  The s. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  was considered to expensive for export. G139 MKA  Trials of the engines available were to take place as well, in a dummy with the same conditions equivalent to use in a tank. G139 MKA  The following names were given to the vehicles being produced for simplicity in the manufacturing firms; 
◾ L10 for the M. G139 MKA G. G139 MKA  K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  (l. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  1) 
◾ L20 for the 2cm K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  (l. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  2) 
◾ M10 for the 4,5cm K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA v. G139 MKA  (m. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA ) 

The names that contained the weaponry (ex: 2cm K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA ) as opposed to the other names (ex: l. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  2) were to be kept for correspondence with the Waffenamt and foreign nations. G139 MKA  

On 3 June 1937, the characteristics of the m. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  were finalized (information is in the infobox above and to the right) 

On 17 June 1937, Wa Prüf 6 decided that Krupp's design bureau (Krupp Konstruktionsbuero) was to be maintained at current size, but they were not given design contracts. G139 MKA  Design work was to continue on the export vehicles, however it was decided whether they would be released for export, or it may be presented to the German Army for possible adoption. G139 MKA  Oberstleutnant Phillips stated that Wa Prüf 6, like other Waffen Prüfen, supports development of products intended for export, and that they have no objections releasing the new motor to Krupp. G139 MKA  

On 21 June 1937, Hageloch, Müller, and Wölfert met and decided that work would start and continue on the m. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  until further contracts were received by Wa Prüf 6. G139 MKA  They decided to find another engine in case the engine from Maybach wasn't released. G139 MKA  Completion of the first chassis was considered possible for March 1938. G139 MKA  

On 10 August 1937, Hageloch and Wölfert met with Oberstleutnant Phillips, head of Wa Prüf 6, to discuss the release of the Maybach HL 76 motor. G139 MKA  

On 31 August 1937, Wa Prüf 6 advised Krupp that due to the long period of which the Maybach HL 76 is not ready, the Maybach D. G139 MKA S. G139 MKA O. G139 MKA  8 motor rated at 155hp @ 2600rpm is recommended in its place. G139 MKA  

On 4 October 1937, Krupp started developing a 45mm semi-automatic cannon with an L/50 (2. G139 MKA 250m) barrel length. G139 MKA  The gun weighed 1,385kg, it had a muzzle velocity of 750m/s. G139 MKA  Armour penetration was 40mm @ 1000m/90°. G139 MKA  Design of the cannon were to be completed by 20 October 1937, turret design completed by March 1938, and a turret produced by 1 August 1938. G139 MKA  

On 7 October 1937, the Heereswaffenamt sent Krupp a list of restrictions on the design of tanks for export purposes. G139 MKA  
1. G139 MKA  Only a straight monocular or fixed angular telescopic gunsight (such as the Ceha - telescope from Askania), or a periscope gunsight without removable head can be used. G139 MKA  
2. G139 MKA  Slip ring contacts are allowable for conducting electricity to the turret. G139 MKA  
3. G139 MKA  Visors for vision ports can have internal hinges but cannot have overlapping edges exceeding 1mm wide. G139 MKA  Additional locks are not to be used. G139 MKA  
4. G139 MKA  Rigidly mounted protective glass up to 12mm thick is allowed behind the vision slits. G139 MKA  The slits are to be cut into flat visor plates and are not allowed to be less than 5. G139 MKA 5mm wide. G139 MKA  External ridges to protect the vision slits are to be sloped at less than 4 degrees. G139 MKA  
5. G139 MKA  Sealing frames for the visors are not to have rubber inserts. G139 MKA  Armour plates for covering the vision slits are not to be delivered. G139 MKA  
6. G139 MKA  The detailed design of the gun mantle is to be presented for approval on a case-by-case basis. G139 MKA  It can be patterned after the first model of the gun mantle for the PzKpfw I. G139 MKA  
7. G139 MKA  Rigidly mounted rod antenna without springs or rigid frame antenna are allowable. G139 MKA  
8. G139 MKA  If a radio is requested, expanding rubber stripes are allowable in the mounting. G139 MKA  
9. G139 MKA  All types of hinges are to be made out of normal steel, not armour. G139 MKA  
10. G139 MKA  It is allowable to use the model of traversing gear for the PzKpfw I. G139 MKA  Steel cables are to be used as a connecting linkage for firing the machineguns. G139 MKA  
11. G139 MKA  Only a single ball-bearing race can be used for the turret mounting. G139 MKA  
12. G139 MKA  Only normal bolts with heads or countersunk can be used. G139 MKA  
13. G139 MKA  The turret design must be either round with 10 degree sloping sides or a symmetrical truncated pyramid shape. G139 MKA  
14. G139 MKA  The German model for mounting an anti-aircraft machinegun is not to be used. G139 MKA  

 End of Development & Trial Model 

On 9 October 1937, Oberstleutnant Phillips sent a letter to Krupp about their decision to not approve the 4,5cm K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA v. G139 MKA  (m. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA ) design for export. G139 MKA  The reasoning was the armour plates armour plates thicker than 13mm (to protect against armour piercing 7. G139 MKA 92mm rounds), and the engine compartment and cooling system closely match the latest methods used for the latest tanks fielded by the German Army, of which proved difficult and was costly to develop. G139 MKA  

On 1 February 1938, Hageloch, Müller, and Wölfert of Krupp met to discuss the status of the trial vehicles. G139 MKA  They decided that they would continue development on the trials, ignoring the previous message from the Waffenamt. G139 MKA  The road wheel mounts were to be designed like the l. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  2, however the patent application for the m. G139 MKA K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA  roadwheels mounts were to be declared secret, as requested by the Waffenamt. G139 MKA  

The gun needs to be completed and fired by the 1st of September 1938, the trial vehicle without a turret is to be completed in September 1938, and the turret completed by December 1938. G139 MKA  The vehicle was tested in early 1939, with good results. G139 MKA  The turret for the K. G139 MKA A. G139 MKA v. G139 MKA  started production in late 1939, but it is unknown whether it was completed. G139 MKA  

The vehicle did not enter production, and Krupp moved on to other projects. G139 MKA
