Known to some players as the '''Waffle''', the '''Waffle-Traktor''' or the more crass '''WTF auf E-100''', the never-before-seen amalgamation of min-maxed extremes known as the WT Auf. G98 Waffentrager E100  E-100 has, quite possibly, been the single most influential vehicle in the history of the Tier X meta-game since its introduction to World of Tanks in patch [[Changelog:_World_of_Tanks_(PC)_Patch_0. G98 Waffentrager E100 8. G98 Waffentrager E100 9|8. G98 Waffentrager E100 9]]. G98 Waffentrager E100  As an obvious result, it also became one of the most troubling to balance. G98 Waffentrager E100  Possessing a choice of two autoloaded guns which did not share the traditionally poor gun handling characteristics of other autoloaders and terminating a line previously known for its stealth and traditional single-fire guns, this extremely visible tank was a monster of firepower that ended up completely redefining the acceptable limitations for autoloader capabilities within World of Tanks. G98 Waffentrager E100  Outputting a previously-unheard-of 3360+ burst damage potential at its launch, the WT Auf. G98 Waffentrager E100  E-100 was not limited by an opposing team's hitpoint pool and could easily decimate entire lanes within seconds. G98 Waffentrager E100  Combining a thinly armored turret, unresistant to any HE round in the game, with a hull whose upper glacis plate armor was immune to nearly any opposition, the WT Auf. G98 Waffentrager E100  E-100 was a tank that never displayed anything but brilliant performance: either brilliantly overwhelming, or brilliantly terrible. G98 Waffentrager E100  In addition to being unfettered by other traditional TD limitations such as traverse, health pool or view range, all of the above points made the WT Auf. G98 Waffentrager E100  E-100 into, by far, the most self-sufficient vehicle in the game. G98 Waffentrager E100  

An entirely fictional tank created out of various components from the German parts bin cobbled together and filed to fit, the WT Auf. G98 Waffentrager E100  E-100 was an anachronism unmatched by any other vehicle in World of Tanks. G98 Waffentrager E100   Because of this, and being an impossible to balance machine, the WT Auf. G98 Waffentrager E100  E-100 was eventually removed from the game and replaced with the [[Grille 15]] in patch 9. G98 Waffentrager E100 15. G98 Waffentrager E100  However, the Chinese Server has since brought it back as a Tier 10 Premium Tank Destroyer for ~136$, and this monstrosity continues to terrorize the XBox server.

|InTheGame_pros=
- Incredible damage with one magazine

- Quick reload between shells in the magazine

- Insanely fast aim time for the 12. G98 Waffentrager E100 8cm gun 

- Excellent shell velocity on the 12. G98 Waffentrager E100 8cm gun. G98 Waffentrager E100  Makes for a great sniping experience

- Very thick hull armor

- High speed despite its large size (40 KM/H)

|InTheGame_cons=
- Worst camouflage rating in the game. G98 Waffentrager E100  Enormous size guarantees that most bushes & trees won't be able to fully conceal your tank

- Extremely vulnerable turret which will succumb to every HE round in the game

- Low Penetration for both the standard and premium ammunition. G98 Waffentrager E100  Will struggle against heavily armored targets

- Priority target, due to incredible firepower and thin turret. G98 Waffentrager E100  Also loathed by most players

- Very long magazine reload time, as par for the course with other autoloading vehicles

|InTheGame_performance= This tank lies in wait for 56 seconds, hears the click of the magazine locking, and then unleashes death on the other team. G98 Waffentrager E100  And then repeats the cycle. G98 Waffentrager E100  It's a bit one-dimensional, as far as tanks go. G98 Waffentrager E100  With 5 shells in the 128, or 4 in the 150, it may not kill a Maus outright, but it's still more than enough to wreck an opposing push or turn a fight. G98 Waffentrager E100 

Sadly, it has very punishing gameplay - either you're close enough to the fight to make use of your clip, where you will easily be destroyed from hits to the turret, which can be penetrated by the actual worst gun in the game, the [[Tank:A02_M2_lt|. G98 Waffentrager E100 50 caliber browning machine gun]], or you're staying so far back that RNG will make 2 or 3, if not more, of your shells bite the dust. G98 Waffentrager E100  And should you make any kind of mistake, you will die before you can even react. G98 Waffentrager E100 

Since its introduction on live servers, the WT-100 has been rebalanced twice since its introduction in patch 0. G98 Waffentrager E100 8. G98 Waffentrager E100 9. G98 Waffentrager E100  In the [[Changelog:_World_of_Tanks_(PC)_Patch_0. G98 Waffentrager E100 8. G98 Waffentrager E100 11|8. G98 Waffentrager E100 11]] update (lost 10% hitpoints and worsened gun dispersion) and again in the [[Changelog:_World_of_Tanks_(PC)_Patch_0. G98 Waffentrager E100 9. G98 Waffentrager E100 2|9. G98 Waffentrager E100 2]] update (major reduction in power for the 128mm gun, notably reduction in magazine size and DPM decrease). G98 Waffentrager E100  And later in the end, removed and replaced with Grille 15 in the 9. G98 Waffentrager E100 15 patch. G98 Waffentrager E100  It still haunts the XBox version to this day. G98 Waffentrager E100 

|InTheGame_research= This tank comes elite save the 150mm gun in its stock configuration if it was not researched on the Waffentr√§ger auf PZ IV. G98 Waffentrager E100  As the WT 100 is played, eventually enough XP will be pooled to unlock this. G98 Waffentrager E100 

Edit: As this tank is now a Premium tier 10 tank in the Chinese server, no research is needed, the 150 mm has been removed and it comes elited. G98 Waffentrager E100  However it keeps all its post-removal stats in the XBox version as mentioned earlier. G98 Waffentrager E100

|HistAcc=
