| Also known as ''Derp Demon''. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The '''O-I''' is basically a [[KV-2]] on steroids. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Not only does it carry the most powerful gun of its tier, the O-I also sports some of the toughest protection in tier 6; it easily can hold itself against tier 7 tanks with its thick armor & raw firepower. J24 Mi To 130 tons  It had two gun choices; a powerful 10cm AP gun with high penetration and a trademark 15cm "derp gun" with insane alpha damage. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The O-I has the similar distinctive look like it's brother "O-I exp" and offers a unique, fun play style with it's Insane armor & raw firepower. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

However, like every Japanese heavy tank after tier 4, it is huge and massive (even larger than most of tier 10s) as well as quite slow, and will usually become the primary target of SPGs, gold rounds and flankers. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

As of update 1. J24 Mi To 130 tons 9, the O-I is no longer researched from the O-I Exp. J24 Mi To 130 tons  it is instead researched from the Chi-Nu. J24 Mi To 130 tons

|InTheGame_pros= 
- Choice of two guns: 10cm gun and 15cm gun, both of which have ridiculously high ammunition stock. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- High Hp (1060) + insane 150mm front armor with next to no true weakspots gives even some tier VII's problems, and able to take tremendous punishment before going down. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- Excellent view range, especially for a heavy. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- Has tall turret, very easy to shoot over cover & allied tanks. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- 15cm is capable of two-shotting most tanks in its tier, like the KV-2, even with AP. J24 Mi To 130 tons  It is also slightly more accurate. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- Insane mass + high hp engine makes it good at shoving dead tanks for additional cover and highly resistant to rams. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- Because of Large Mass, tank is able to mount Superheavy spall liner, increasing already excellent survivability even more. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- Moderately easy stock grind since the 10cm gun deals a large amount of damage and has great penetration. J24 Mi To 130 tons  And doesn't need tracks to mount modules and lacks additional turret to research. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- Shares most of its modules with other later Japanese super-heavies. J24 Mi To 130 tons  You can grind and research the radio and engine for the next tank. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- Fear factor: powerful, high damaging gun + thick armor all around makes it a scary tank to face. J24 Mi To 130 tons 


|InTheGame_cons=
- Huge size and weak side armor leaves O-I very vulnerable to flanking, artillery and gold rounds. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Though rear armor is thicker than sides, and the rear mini turret is strong as the front ones. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Difficult to hide and sports hideous camo ratings. J24 Mi To 130 tons  

- Both guns, especially the howitzer, are inaccurate, have long aim time and poor gun handling. J24 Mi To 130 tons  

- While surprisingly accurate at long range, ironically the howitzer has an infuriating tendency to miss at point blank range, often with fatal results. J24 Mi To 130 tons   

- Horrifyingly poor mobility, bad ground resistance, slow acceleration and bad top speed (25 km/h) makes for a really slow tank. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- Terrible camouflage ratings, can be easily spotted. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- Absolutely terrible DPM on both guns; 15cm has even longer reload than KV-2 and 10cm has absolutely terrible DPM (300 worse than O-I Experimental despite being higher tier!)

- Inner side armor is only 30mm thick and possible to hit and overmatch from hole above tracks. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

- Will still have to rely on HE in most cases against some tier 7s. J24 Mi To 130 tons

In terms of firepower, the O-I has it in spades. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Stock, the tank comes with an excellent 10cm gun capable of going through any tank you might have to face while dealing respectable damage with decent accuracy, but a rather long aim time. J24 Mi To 130 tons  There is a second gun for the O-I and it is a 15cm devastating alpha howitzer, similar to that mounted on the KV-2, with a slightly slower rate of fire, lower accuracy and a horrid aim time. J24 Mi To 130 tons  However, this gun can be a lot of fun to play, especially when striking lightly armored foes which is common at tier 6. J24 Mi To 130 tons  

Game play with the 10cm gun allows you to engage targets at a longer range and good penetration. J24 Mi To 130 tons  It also allows you to play a more supportive role by sniping when you are bottom tier. J24 Mi To 130 tons  With this gun, it allows an O-I to laugh at opposing heavy tank's armor, while you effortlessly bounce incoming fire. J24 Mi To 130 tons  With the 10cm gun, it also allows you to more reliably handle opposing O-Is. J24 Mi To 130 tons  However, 10cm is more ineffective against higher tier heavies as well as loses its feared ability to one-shot tanks. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Be wary that while the gun reloads faster than howitzer, it still has very low DPM and poor accuracy which means that O-I wont deal damage very quickly. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

With the 15cm derp cannon, your play style will have to change radically to make up for the shortcomings of the gun's long aim time and poor accuracy. J24 Mi To 130 tons  This means that getting up close and personal in any brawl will allow you to negate your gun's main problems and ensure every shell hits. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Having knowledge of what might appear in front of your tank is crucial as well, to make sure the correct shell is loaded. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The AP shell in the 15cm gun is better than that in the KV-2, with improved penetration. J24 Mi To 130 tons  121mm may not seem like much, but at tier 6, it is sufficient to go through many tanks frontally. J24 Mi To 130 tons  In exchange for the better AP shells, the HE shells do not penetrate as much armor, as compared to the ones on the KV-2. J24 Mi To 130 tons  However, thin-skinned targets will be wrecked easily by it. J24 Mi To 130 tons  When you are bottom tier, the large caliber HE shell will allow you to do damage in all situations, as long as the shell hits your target. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

In conclusion, the O-I is ridiculously powerful for a tier 6 vehicle. J24 Mi To 130 tons  It has a flexible choice of guns for different play styles. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The O-I has also seen increased use in tier 6 strongholds due to it's armor and derp gun. J24 Mi To 130 tons  It should be noted that the gun depression is a lie - it is only -10 degrees in the very front in between the two turrets, and is between 4 degrees and 6 degrees everywhere else. J24 Mi To 130 tons

|History= 

The O-I (オイ車 Oi-sensha) was a super-heavy tank prototype designed by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War after the Battles of Nomonhan in 1939. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The O-I is one of the Second World War’s more secretive tank projects, with documentation regarding the tank being kept private for over 75 years at Wakajishi Shrine, Fujinomiya. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Surviving files have been purchased by FineMolds Inc. J24 Mi To 130 tons , and publicly previewed in mid-2015. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The multi-turreted 150-ton tank was designed for use on the Manchurian plains as a supportive pillbox for the Imperial Japanese against the Soviet Union. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The project was disbanded four years after the initial development began, deemed unsatisfactory for continuation in 1943 after the lack of resource material for the prototype. J24 Mi To 130 tons

==History and development==

After 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army quickly came to realize that previous forms of mechanized warfare were proved inefficient after their defeat at Khalkhin Gol. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

Development of the super-heavy project was spearheaded by Colonel Hideo Iwakuro, the head of the Ministry of War of Japan (陸軍省 Rikugun-shō). J24 Mi To 130 tons  Iwakuro opposed Japan’s advances towards the Soviet Union in 1939, and with the Japanese defeat, he decided to initiate a project to construct a heavily armored tank capable of withstanding large-calibre field cannons. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Iwakuro assigned Colonel Murata of the 4th Technical Research Group to design and construct the super heavy tank in 1939. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Colonel Murata noted Iwakuro’s words as described;


「満州の大平原で移動トーチカとして使えるような巨大戦車を作ってほしい。極秘でだ。」
“I want a huge tank built which can be used as a mobile pillbox in the wide open plains of Manchuria. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Top secret. J24 Mi To 130 tons ”


「今の戦車の寸法を2倍に延ばして作れ。」
“Make the dimensions twice that of today’s tanks. J24 Mi To 130 tons ”


The 4th Technical Research Group began designing the super-heavy vehicle throughout 1940, attempting to meet Colonel Iwakuro’s vague instructions on the ultimate goal of the project. J24 Mi To 130 tons  By March 1941, the research group had finished initial tank design and was ready to begin construction. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The following month, a group of pre-selected engineers were chosen to partake in the building of the super-heavy tank. J24 Mi To 130 tons  One recorded engineer was Shigeo Otaka, who stated they were sent to the 4th Technical Research Group’s previous headquarters in Tokyo. J24 Mi To 130 tons  There, they were guided through a barracks containing multiple small fitting rooms, where they were to conduct meetings and reports on the progress of construction of the super-heavy vehicle. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Towards the end of the barracks facility was a fully-enclosed room devoid of windows, with soundproofed walls to prevent external personnel from overhearing discussions related to the project. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Each officer present possessed a portion of the project’s blueprint, which, when assembled, projected the full design of the tank, labelled "Mi-To". J24 Mi To 130 tons  The name originated from a collection of the Mitsubishi industry and the city, Tokyo; given to the vehicle to uphold secrecy of the tank’s project. J24 Mi To 130 tons

The chosen engineers voiced their concerns regarding the Mi-To’s design noting that previously, the largest-sized Japanese tank had been the prototype Type95 Heavy in 1934. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Issues that had been noted with heavy tank experiments in the years preceding the Mi-To showing Japan’s generally unsuccessful testing on multi-turreted vehicles exceeding the weight of standard armored vehicles. J24 Mi To 130 tons  However, with the threat of a second Russo-Japanese conflict becoming more apparent, the project continued despite the engineer’s doubts on the size and mobility of the vehicle.

On April 14th 1941, the engineers began the construction of the Mi-To under secretive means. J24 Mi To 130 tons  This entailed privately-made mechanical parts and equipment being shipped to the construction zone. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Colonel Murata’s original concept was to complete the super-heavy tank three months after the initiation of Mi-To’s construction. J24 Mi To 130 tons  This, ultimately, did not come into fruition; as technical issues on the project began to arise. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Due to the limitation on material consumption by the government, the amount of parts that could be secretly shipped-in began to dwindle. J24 Mi To 130 tons  By the first month of construction, essential construction resources had been depleted and the issues with the vehicle’s cooling system further caused delays. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The construction of the Mi-To was postponed until January 1942, a delay of nine months. J24 Mi To 130 tons 


After the Mi-To’s construction was resumed, the hull was completed on February 8th 1942. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The tank had reached near-completion and was being prepared for mobility testing. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Mitsubishi built the four turrets for the tank in May of the same year. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Initial assembly of the tank’s armament took place soon after the turret’s superstructures were completed. J24 Mi To 130 tons  However; the project once again did not have the necessary resources needed for the few remaining parts required for the final assessment. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Due to this, the primary turret was removed as it lacked a 35-millimetre-thick roof plate, which had not yet arrived. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Thus, the project was put on standby, until further development could continue. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The total weight of the vehicle at the time was 96 tons, due to the lack of remaining structural plates and absent 75mm bolted-on armor. J24 Mi To 130 tons

The date on which the construction of the tank resumed is unknown, although active testing of the tank was scheduled for late 1943. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The tank was unveiled to the Imperial Japanese Army’s highest command in 1943, and received a name change to O-I. J24 Mi To 130 tons  This followed Japanese naming convention (O translating to Heavy, I for First, making it "First Heavy") that was standard. J24 Mi To 130 tons  In his place was Lieutenant Colonel Nakano, Murata's assistant and colleague. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Tomio Hara, head of the Sagamia Army Arsenal, was also present. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Following the demonstration, senior officials within the IJA requested that field trials begin in August of the same year. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The tank was disassembled at 2:00 AM one night in June of 1943 and sent to the Sagami Army Arsenal in Sagamihara, 51 kilometres from Tokyo. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The vehicle arrived at the depot in June, and was reassembled and tested on the 1st of August. J24 Mi To 130 tons 

On the day of the trials, the O-I performed satisfactorily until the second hour of the tests. J24 Mi To 130 tons  While manoeuvring on off-road terrain, the tank sank into the ground by up to a meter; attempts at traversing the hull to extricate the vehicle proved fruitless, resulting in further sinking due to the vehicle’s suspension coils compressing. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The tank was eventually towed out, and further testing was continued on concrete. J24 Mi To 130 tons  However, the earlier damage to the suspension resulted in vehicle’s movement damaging the concrete, which in turn, further damaged the suspension bogies to the point that further testing could not continue. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The trials were postponed, and later cancelled the following day. J24 Mi To 130 tons 


Nevertheless, the trials conducted at the testing field were considered to be a success, and the vehicle was deemed ready for use in spite of its flaws. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The engineers began disassembly of the tank on the 3rd of August due to resources being limited and the inability to maintain the tank in the field. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Disassembly of the tank was completed on August 8th. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Two days later, the engineers noted in a log that they were to inspect the parts and conduct research to fix the issues the O-I would face. J24 Mi To 130 tons 


The fate of the O-I after its field-trials which took place on the 1st of August is unclear. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Russian reports claim the Japanese were in possession of a wooden O-I mock-up mounting a Daimler-Benz DB 601A engine in 1945, however other sources point to the scrapping of the remaining parts of the same year. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The remains of the O-I reside at the Wakajishi Shrine, with a track link of the prototype still present. J24 Mi To 130 tons

==Design==
The O-I was conceived out of the necessity to produce an armored vehicle capable of withstanding modern weaponry being able to return fire with similar firepower. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The O-I was designed to act as a mobile pillbox, supporting infantry and mechanized groups along the border  of the Soviet Union. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The tank had a length of 10. J24 Mi To 130 tons 1 meters, width of 4. J24 Mi To 130 tons 8 meters, and a height of 3. J24 Mi To 130 tons 6 meters. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The dimensions of the vehicle closely matched those of the Panzer VIII Maus. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The tank was envisioned to have a standard thickness of 150 millimeters front and rear, in order to protect against common anti-tank weapons of the time, yet it was constructed with armor 75 millimeters thick. J24 Mi To 130 tons  However, an additional armor plate could be bolted on to bring the total thickness of the armor to 150 millimeters. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The use of additional armor allowed for ease of construction and transportation, while also providing the tank with additional defense. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Side armor on the hull superstructure was 70 millimeters thick. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The additional armor plates were 35 millimeters thick,  but armor surrounding the suspension was only 35 millimeters thick. J24 Mi To 130 tons  This made the tank’s theoretical armor on the side 75 millimeters. J24 Mi To 130 tons   There were eight wheel-supporting beams located on both sides of the suspension area which added an additional 40 millimeters of armor to specific locations on the side of the O-I. J24 Mi To 130 tons  40 ladder pieces were placed around the tank to provide crew with the ability to climb onto of the vehicle with ease. J24 Mi To 130 tons 


The two 47mm cannons used in the two frontal turrets were also modified to fit the armor layout of the tank. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The weapon’s barrels were reinforced with steel to secure them to the tank, due to the standard gun not adequately fitting into the turret. J24 Mi To 130 tons

The tank was both designed and built with two inner armor plates to divide the interior into three sections; walls with two doors each and an ultimate thickness of 20mm. J24 Mi To 130 tons  This allowed the crew and modules to remain relatively safe while the structure was kept safe with supporting stands. J24 Mi To 130 tons  These supports allowed the interior armor plates to stay stable and also prevented collapse. J24 Mi To 130 tons  Inside the O-I were two Kawasaki V-12 engines, both located in the rear, parallel lengthwise, to give room for the rear turret operator and transmission. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The transmission copied that of the Type97 Chi-Ha’s, but used larger parts and gears making the total weight heavier. J24 Mi To 130 tons  The vehicle had a coil spring system, with eight 2 wheeled boggies, totalling 16 individual wheels. J24 Mi To 130 tons
