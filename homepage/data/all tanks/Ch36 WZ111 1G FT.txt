Compared to its predecessors, the WZ-111-1G FT is a significant shift in terms of playstyle in the Chinese line. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  First of all, it is based on a heavy tank chassis, unlike previous Chinese tank destroyers which are based on medium tanks. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  Hence, this tank is much larger, has worse top speed and agility, but is better armored and carries one of the most powerful guns available to Tier 8 vehicles. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT 

First of all, this tank's survivability is abysmal. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  It has the lowest hitpoint pool among Tier 8 tank destroyers, with only the [[UDES 03]] and the [[AMX AC Mle. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  48]] sharing this dubious honor. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  Its armor is also nothing spectacular - the frontal arc is good enough to bounce most lower tiered enemies, but against same tiers or upper tiers it breaks very easily, though surprising bounces are still possible, if rare. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  The sides and rear are, unsurprisingly, quite weak. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  These are significant weaknesses for what is essentially an "assault gun" TD. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT 

The mobility is also a downgrade compared to the preceding tanks in the line. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  Being based on a heavy tank chassis, the WZ-111-1G FT has a decent but uninspiring top speed, and a similarly unimpressive hull traverse speed. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  It enjoys a good reverse speed though, in case it needs to quickly retreat, such as after firing a shot or being lit up by enemy tanks. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  Regardless, as a turretless and fairly large target it can easily fall victim of fast flankers, such as medium and light tanks. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT 

Where the WZ-111-1G FT stands out is the firepower. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  It takes a truly brutal grind to unlock it, but the 130mm 59-130JG FT gun is the second strongest tank destroyer gun in Tier 8 in terms of hard stats. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  It's essentially a weaker, Chinese copy of the top 12,8cm gun found on the Tier 9 [[Jagdtiger]] - it enjoys massive alpha damage and overkill penetration for its tier, as well as a fairly decent accuracy for such a large gun, though its shell velocity and aim time are quite punishing and make sniping (something this tank will be forced to often do) fairly frustrating. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  The stock gun is unfortunately underpowered for its tier, and the second gun, while a significant improvement, is little more than a "grind gun". Ch36 WZ111 1G FT 

Overall, the WZ-111-1G FT is a vehicle of extremes and one of the truer "glass cannons" among tank destroyers in its tier spread. Ch36 WZ111 1G FT  Its massive firepower once upgraded is often hard to put to good use because the tank itself is so fragile, and the worse mobility compared to its predecessors can be an unwelcome experience for those who enjoyed the line so far.
