|Often nicknamed "The Rat", the Renault UE 57 is currently The second Smallest "Tank" in the game (after [[Tank:Pl01_TKS_20mm|TKS 20mm]]). F52 RenaultUE57  Its most obvious features are its great gun choices, starting with the same gun from the FT AC. F52 RenaultUE57  Its next 57mm is an excellent gun for its tier and can penetrate almost anything it comes across. F52 RenaultUE57  However, its armor can't bounce anything, but if you get shots off on your enemy before they do they'll most likely be dead. F52 RenaultUE57  It has a great rate of fire, though the elevation, traverse and depression of the gun are very limited. F52 RenaultUE57  It's also a relatively fast tank, which is negated by its terrible traverse speed. F52 RenaultUE57  In all it's best used to snipe from afar using its highly accurate and great gun, as you won't last long if you get very close to the front line. F52 RenaultUE57 

This tank is quite hard to play and is not at all rewarding, most of the time. F52 RenaultUE57  If you have a good game then you have a great game, but these are few and far between. F52 RenaultUE57  This tank will be a very, very hard grind, especially since you have to research the tier 4 through a second gun, which adds and extra 3,600 exp onto your grind. F52 RenaultUE57

|InTheGame_pros=
* Second camouflage values in the game when stationary, as well as when firing and a very small silhouette. F52 RenaultUE57 
* Fast rate of fire. F52 RenaultUE57  Extremely fast-firing, accurate stock weapon 
* Good speed and acceleration for a Tier 3 TD, similar to the SU-76
* Very small size makes it hard to hit
* Contrary to its typically sluggish traverse speed, it can perform tight handbrake turns from high speed on a dime. F52 RenaultUE57 

|InTheGame_cons=
* Some of the worst gun depression in the game at 2 degrees, lower than every SPG of its tier, and twice as low as the second worst gun depression of its tier (4 degrees). F52 RenaultUE57  
* Very narrow arc of fire. F52 RenaultUE57  Worthless armor and front-mounted engine is easily knocked out
* Poor traverse speed, and nearly untraversable on sloped terrain; top engine is only +10 horsepower and +5% chance for fire
* 6-pounder gun can only fire AP and APCR rounds, and borders on inaccurate for a sniping role. F52 RenaultUE57 
* The lightest tank in game at 2. F52 RenaultUE57 7 tons; extremely vulnerable to ramming even by light tanks. F52 RenaultUE57 
* It tends to rock on braking because of its light weight, making aiming difficult when stopping. F52 RenaultUE57  
* Vastly inferior to the Ikv 72 (12 degrees of gun depression and 50% higher top speed) in every aspect - including camo values (the UE 57's gimmick) - except for DPM (by 17%), penetration (by 13%; makes no difference at this tier), view range (by 7%), and size. F52 RenaultUE57

Recently nicknamed the "Rat" as it literally can fit into even the smallest of hiding places without getting spotted and keep hitting the enemy with a very fast firing 6-Pounder Gun. F52 RenaultUE57  Its low profile greatly helps this tank as even the [[BT-7]] will have to aim down on you once you are spotted. F52 RenaultUE57  

This tank can be a lot of fun to play, but it has a very steep learning curve and is unforgiving if you try to step outside of its role as a sniper. F52 RenaultUE57  If you try to fight at close range, you will die very quickly and very painfully. F52 RenaultUE57  To use this tank to the best of its abilities, keep these things in mind:
*You have great accuracy, a good rate of fire, and a very good view range. F52 RenaultUE57  Stay far back and wait for the enemy to expose themselves, then pick them off from long range. F52 RenaultUE57  In maps where there are large open spaces, your 360m view range and very stealthy characteristics can let you serve as a great sentry, but otherwise, stick to sniping. F52 RenaultUE57 
*Never let the enemy get in close. F52 RenaultUE57  Your armor is paper-thin and you don't have that many hit-points, so you're extremely vulnerable to enemy fire. F52 RenaultUE57  Also, you're so light in weight that ramming attacks will almost always kill you. F52 RenaultUE57  Stay in the second line and try to keep some teammates between you and the enemy. F52 RenaultUE57 
*DO NOT GO OFF ON YOUR OWN! Your speed and traverse are good enough to let you shift position in a hurry, but not good enough to keep you from being circled with ease if enemy tanks surround you. F52 RenaultUE57 
*Your tank is very, very light. F52 RenaultUE57  Although 100% worth it, equipment like a camouflage net, binoculars, ect. F52 RenaultUE57  will give a noticeable downgrade in mobility. F52 RenaultUE57  That said, equipment, especially the camouflage net, helps this tank immensely because it it already has excellent camouflage values; being a tank with one of the lowest profiles in the game. F52 RenaultUE57 

|InTheGame_research=
* Unlike many vehicles in the game, your stock suspension has a very good load limit. F52 RenaultUE57  Because of this, you don't necessarily need to research the suspension first. F52 RenaultUE57 
* Researching the Renault ACL engine is inexpensive and worthwhile. F52 RenaultUE57 
* The best strategy for researching might be to keep grinding to unlock the 6-pounder, using any free XP you manage to accumulate along the way to research the suspension and radio upgrades. F52 RenaultUE57

|History=
Renault UE 57 was a prototype vehicle built by the forces of Free French Forces commanded by Charles de Gaulle in exile, while France was under German occupation. F52 RenaultUE57  Developed in England 1943, the design was very crude, and it can hardly be justified even when taking into consideration the lack of funds and resources Free French Forces were suffering from. F52 RenaultUE57  Essentially, it was a Renault UE artillery tractor with the small lightly armored superstructure on the rear of the vehicle. F52 RenaultUE57  Main armament was to be British ''Six pounder'', 57 mm anti tank gun which was at the time already obsolete. F52 RenaultUE57  Only one prototype was ever built, which was to serve as a demonstrator for the eventual small series manufacture. F52 RenaultUE57  After the disappointing trials, all further development stopped, and all production plans were cancelled. F52 RenaultUE57  After cancellation the armament was removed, and the vehicle was converted back to the artillery tractor. F52 RenaultUE57
