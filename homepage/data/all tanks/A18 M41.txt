|Designed as a replacement for the M7 Priest self-propelled howitzer, the M41 is a typical American self-propelled artillery piece, having a wide weapon traverse, good gun with good accuracy and a spectacularly poor hull traverse coupled with a high top speed

After its rebalance to tier V, the M41 will feel right at home in any match that it gets placed, as its 155mm howitzer is capable of dealing apocalyptic damage to any tank it gets to encounter and effective range that spans from one corner to a map to much of the other. A18 M41  However, mind that the shell travel time is slower than other Tier 5 SPGs. A18 M41  Players coming fresh from the [[M37]] will never have to worry about poking higher-tier enemies for insignificant damage. A18 M41

|InTheGame_pros= 
* Gun range: 1300 m
* High top speed on flat ground
* Good gun arc
* Only one gun, no grinding required and is very enjoyable when stock
* Extremely low ammo cost for such a powerful gun

|InTheGame_cons=
* Horrible accuracy
* Long aiming time
* Slow acceleration
* Slow traverse speed
* Large reticule spread when traversing the gun
* Only one gun (although very well performing)
* Very expensive to purchase compared to tier V tanks

After the total rebalance of every artillery piece, the M41 is now one tier lower (VI->V) and receives standard tank matchmaking (battle tiers V-VII). A18 M41  
Formerly known for what was arguably the most enjoyable stock grind of any artillery piece (excluding tier IIs) in the game, the M41 embodies the American artillery playstyle very well: Good damage, good rate of fire, good accuracy, good top speed, great weapon traverse arc and horrible tank traverse speeds. A18 M41  The M41 is very similar to the old M41, but is arguably more enjoyable since it meets tier FIVE and SIX tanks, something impossible previous to this patch. A18 M41  The 155mm Howitzer M1's HE shells can regularly one-shot or penetrate KV-1s, KV-1S'es, KV-2s, French tanks and every medium tank in its matchmaking bracket, causing catastrophic damage to anything it sees. A18 M41  Non-penetrating shells still deal large damage, since its base damage is already high. A18 M41  Non-penetrating hits for above 300 damage are common. A18 M41  However, the M41 now suffers from a significant amount of reticule bloom. A18 M41  Be sure to move the reticule slowly and deliberately to preserve accuracy. A18 M41  The M41 shoots slowly now, although the great damage of the gun and cheap ammunition costs balance it out. A18 M41 

After the nerfs and removal of many of its engines, the M41 does not accelerate as well as it used to. A18 M41  However, its 15HP/ton ratio when upgraded and its high speed limit coupled with low weight allows it to outrun heavier tanks in contingencies. A18 M41 

Worthy of special mention is the very low ammunition costs of the M41's 155mm howitzer. A18 M41  The Grille has a 680 damage gun costing 505 credits per shot, the Hummel has a 950 damage gun that costs 1150 credits per shot, the SU-122A has a 910 damage gun costing 810 credits per shot, compared to the M41's much more favorable 700 damage costing a meager 505 credits per shot, making the M41 a much more favorable moneymaking artillery piece. A18 M41  However, it no longer meets tier VIII and IX enemies, which somewhat hurts its moneymaking potential: Damaging higher tiers have a higher amount of money gained per damage. A18 M41 

With that said, the M41 is an excellent tier V artillery piece, balancing agility, damage, speed and ammunition cost for a jack-of-all-trades artillery piece. A18 M41

* Since 8. A18 M41 6 update, now all M37's engines and radios will carry over if you researched them previously. A18 M41 
* The SCR 610 and SCR 619 radios are also used by the [[M8A1]], so they will be available if you played it prior to the M41. A18 M41 
* Research the Twin Cadillac Series 44T4 engine first since it has an inexpensive XP cost. A18 M41 
* Next research the SCR 610 radio . A18 M41 
* Lastly research the SCR 619 radio so you can once again have the excellent radio range if you haven't already. A18 M41

The self-propelled howitzer M41 was based on a lengthened M24 Chaffee chassis, and had many of the same modifications as the hull of the M19 self-propelled twin 40mm anti-aircraft gun. A18 M41  The M41's engine was moved to behind the drivers' compartment, and the 155mm howitzer mount was placed at the rear of the vehicle. A18 M41  Of the 250 ordered, 60 were delivered. A18 M41
