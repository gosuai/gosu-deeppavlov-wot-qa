|This SPG is excellent example of most of the French artillery line. F25 Lorraine155 51  It carries one of the least damaging guns of its class and tier; however, that weakness is mitigated by a better rate of fire, accuracy, and aim time compared to others SPGs of its tier. F25 Lorraine155 51  Though unimpressive, the 155 51 still carries enough firepower to perform well in its role. F25 Lorraine155 51  The most unique feature of this vehicle is clearly its unmatched mobility. F25 Lorraine155 51  No other SPG of this tier can move faster, making relocating an easy task; it can even outrun some mediums tanks, if necessary. F25 Lorraine155 51

[[image:Lorraine155 02 Prototype n° 2 photo ECPA. F25 Lorraine155 51 jpg|thumb|200px|left|Lorraine 155 mm model 1951]]
In 1950, Lorraine started the development of its own self-propelled gun. F25 Lorraine155 51  Lorraine’s engineers proposed two different concepts on the same chassis, although at certain point of the development even a wheeled chassis was considered as an alternative to the tracked one. F25 Lorraine155 51  Official names of the prototypes were “1a” (model 1950) and “2a” (model 1951). F25 Lorraine155 51  The main armament of both prototypes was 155 mm howitzer. F25 Lorraine155 51  First prototype, marked as “model 1950” had its howitzer mounted in the centrally placed casemate, while the “model 1951” had the structure pushed to the front of the vehicle. F25 Lorraine155 51  Early versions had a Talbot made engine, but by the year 1951 a Maybach engine was installed. F25 Lorraine155 51  

Trials revealed a number of serious design flaws, so in 1954 a model with a fully rotating turret was considered. F25 Lorraine155 51  As at the time Batignolles Chatillon was already involved in development of similar project, Lorraine’s ideas were rejected, and all further development was cancelled.
