Similar to its Tier 9 counterpart, the AMX 30 B is very much a dedicated support tank. F72 AMX 30  It enjoys excellent DPM and rather good gun handling with a quick aimtime, along with a good top speed and agility, but is outmatched by pretty much every other Tier 10 medium tank in terms of penetration - its standard penetration is as low as the [[TVP T 50/51]]'s, and its premium penetration is downright horrible for a Tier 10 medium tank (and if that wasn't enough, its premium ammo have a very poor shell velocity). F72 AMX 30  It also does not excel at sniping due to its rather average accuracy, forcing players to take a more active role in battle if they wish to bring good games home. F72 AMX 30  It is advised to make full use of the tank's speed and mobility to reach favorable positions where the gun depression will allow to work ridgelines, maximize the already excellent base viewrange to gain as much spotting damage as available, and support better armed and armored teammates whenever possible. F72 AMX 30   

Overall, the AMX 30 B is a solid improvement over its younger sibling, and shares the same playstyle. F72 AMX 30  On paper some of its stats are near identical, but the 30 B improves in key areas such as DPM, agility, gun handling and viewrange, with next to no drawbacks. F72 AMX 30

|History= 
De Gaulle decided that France, though formally remaining a member, would no longer participate in the NATO military organization. F72 AMX 30  This caused a rift between France and West Germany, which then started to emphasize standardization with American equipment, especially in armament, and to follow the new NATO policy to use multifuel diesel engines. F72 AMX 30 German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss began to oppose the common tank project. F72 AMX 30  In July 1963, the defence committee of the German Bundesrat decided to procure a purely national tank. F72 AMX 30  In response, the same month the French government decided likewise

Comparative trials were nevertheless held at Mailly-le-Camp, Meppen, Bourges and Satory between five French and five German prototypes between August and October 1963, under Italian, Dutch, Belgian and American supervision. F72 AMX 30  The French type had received a separate national designation: AMX 30. F72 AMX 30  The trials indicated that the German type, on 1 October also getting its own name Leopard, had a better mobility and acceleration. F72 AMX 30  The French government decided that it could not procure a new tank until 1965, while the Germans refused to adopt the Franco-German 105-millimeter (4. F72 AMX 30 1 in) tank gun, in lieu of the British Royal Ordnance L7, of which they had already ordered 1,500 in the autumn of 1962 their plan having failed for Rheinmetall to produce in Germany a common type of munition of sufficient quality. F72 AMX 30  Suggestions to save the project by combining the French turret with the German chassis failed. F72 AMX 30  As a result, the program was cancelled and the French and Germans definitely decided to adopt their two separate tanks. F72 AMX 30

The prototypes of the AMX-30 weighed 32. F72 AMX 30 5 metric tons (35. F72 AMX 30 8 short tons), and were compact, with a width of 3. F72 AMX 30 1 metres (10 ft), comparable only to the Swiss Panzer 61, and a height of 2. F72 AMX 30 28 meters (7. F72 AMX 30 5 ft), comparable only to the Soviet T-55. F72 AMX 30  In contrast to the AMX 50, the AMX-30 was issued a conventional turret, because it was found that it was more difficult to seal oscillating turrets from radioactive dust and against water when the tank was submerged. F72 AMX 30  Oscillating turrets also had a large ballistic weakness in the area of the skirt and turret ring. F72 AMX 30  Originally, the first two prototypes were powered by a 720 horsepower (540 kW) spark ignition engine, named the SOFAM 12 GSds. F72 AMX 30  Later, a multi-fuel diesel engine was adopted, developed by Hispano-Suiza. F72 AMX 30  The seven 1963 prototypes of the AMX-30 were later rebuilt with the new diesel engine. F72 AMX 30  Two further prototypes, meant to be direct preproduction vehicles, were delivered in November 1965. F72 AMX 30  Besides the diesel engines, they had changed hull and turret casts and different gun mantlets; the latter would again be changed in the production vehicles. F72 AMX 30 

The first production versions of the AMX-30, named AMX 30B to distinguish them from the AMX 30A prototypes, were completed in June 1966, manufactured with a welded and cast hull and a fully cast turret. F72 AMX 30  The production version of the tank had a combat weight of 36 metric tons (40 short tons). F72 AMX 30  The AMX-30's survivability was based on its mobility; French engineers believed that the tank's mobility would have been compromised had they added enough steel plating to protect against modern anti-tank threats, including high explosive anti-tank warheads (HEAT). F72 AMX 30  As a result, the type had the thinnest armour of any main battle tank produced at the time. F72 AMX 30  The turret has a maximum armour thickness of 50 millimetres (2. F72 AMX 30 0 in), the armour sloped at 70 degrees on the front plate and 23 degrees on the side, offering protection against 20-millimetre (0. F72 AMX 30 79 in) armour piercing projectiles. F72 AMX 30  The Line-of-Sight armour values are: 79-millimeter (3. F72 AMX 30 1 in) for the front of the hull; 59-millimetre (2. F72 AMX 30 3 in) for the forward sides of the hull; 30-millimetre (1. F72 AMX 30 2 in) for the rear sides and rear of the hull; 15-millimetre (0. F72 AMX 30 59 in) for the hull top and bottom; 80. F72 AMX 30 8-millimeter (3. F72 AMX 30 18 in) for the turret front; 41. F72 AMX 30 5-millimeter (1. F72 AMX 30 63 in) for the turret sides; 50-millimetre (2. F72 AMX 30 0 in) for the turret rear and 20-millimetre (0. F72 AMX 30 79 in) for the turret top. F72 AMX 30  Further protection is offered by a nuclear, biological and chemical protection suit, including a ventilation system. F72 AMX 30 

One of the unique features of the AMX-30 was the Obus à Charge Creuse de 105 mm Modèle F1 (Obus G) HEAT projectile and its main gun, the Modèle F1, a monoblock steel 105-millimeter (4. F72 AMX 30 1 in) cannon. F72 AMX 30  HEAT warheads suffer when spin stabilized, a product of rifled barrels, causing the French to develop the Obus G, (Gresse). F72 AMX 30  This projectile was composed of two major parts, including the outer shell and a suspended inner shell, divided by ball bearings. F72 AMX 30  This allowed the projectile to be spin-stabilized, and therefore more accurate than a normal fin-stabilized HEAT-round, while the inner shell did not move, allowing the warhead to work at maximum efficiency. F72 AMX 30  The warhead, containing 780 gram hexolite, could penetrate up to 400 millimeters (16 in) of steel armour and was effective against tanks at up to 3,000 meters (3,300 yd). F72 AMX 30  As it combined a good accuracy with a penetration that was independent of range, it has been considered an "ideal round" for its day The AMX-30 was also designed to fire the OCC F1 Mle. F72 AMX 30 60 high explosive projectile, the SCC F1 training warhead and the OFUM PH-105 F1 smoke round. F72 AMX 30  The main gun was coupled with a 380-millimeter (15 in) recoil brake, which had a maximum extension of 400 millimeters (16 in), and could depress to −8 degrees or elevate to 20 degrees. F72 AMX 30  The turret's firepower was augmented by a coaxial 12. F72 AMX 30 7-millimeter (0. F72 AMX 30 50 in) M2 Browning machine gun. F72 AMX 30  The tank commander also made use of a 7. F72 AMX 30 62-millimeter (0. F72 AMX 30 300 in) anti-aircraft machine gun on the turret roof. F72 AMX 30  The vehicle carried 50 105-millimeter (4. F72 AMX 30 1 in) projectiles, 748 12. F72 AMX 30 7-millimeter (0. F72 AMX 30 50 in) rounds and 2,050 7. F72 AMX 30 62-millimeter (0. F72 AMX 30 300 in) bullets. F72 AMX 30  The coaxial machine gun was later replaced by coaxial GIAT 20 mm 20 mm M693 F2 autocannon. F72 AMX 30  The tank commander was issued a cupola which offered ten all-around direct-vision episcopes, and a binocular telescope with 10x magnification. F72 AMX 30  The commander was also given an optical full-field coincidence range finder. F72 AMX 30  The gunner was given a telescoping gun sight and two observation periscopes. F72 AMX 30 

The production version of the AMX-30 was fitted with Hispano-Suiza's HS-110 diesel engine, located in the rear of the hull. F72 AMX 30  The 28. F72 AMX 30 8 liters (1,760 cu in) engine could be replaced on the field in 45 minutes, and produced 720 horsepower (540 kW), offering the tank a maximum velocity of 65 kilometers per hour (40 mph) on roads. F72 AMX 30  The fuel efficient engine, in conjunction with a total fuel capacity of 970 liters (260 U. F72 AMX 30 S. F72 AMX 30  gal), gave the AMX-30 a maximum road range of up to 600 kilometers (370 mi). F72 AMX 30  The engine's drive is taken through a Gravina G. F72 AMX 30 H. F72 AMX 30 B. F72 AMX 30 200C twin-plate centrifugal clutch. F72 AMX 30  The gearbox was an AMX 5-SD-200D, with five forward gears and five reverse gears. F72 AMX 30  This transmission was heavily influenced by that of the German Panther tank and was based on a project which had begun in 1938. F72 AMX 30  The transmission was one of the AMX-30's major faults and caused a variety of mechanical problems, including that the driver would have to manually change gears at specific times, even if the tank was moving over rough terrain. F72 AMX 30  The tank's weight is distributed over five double, aluminum-alloy, rubber-tyred road wheels on either side, propelled on 570-millimeter (22 in) wide tracks. F72 AMX 30  The tank could ford 1. F72 AMX 30 3-meter (1. F72 AMX 30 4 yd) deep water obstacles without preparation, up to 2 meters (2. F72 AMX 30 2 yd) with minor preparation, and up to 4 meters (4. F72 AMX 30 4 yd) with full preparation. F72 AMX 30  Full preparation for water operations consisted of the addition of a snorkel tube, the installation of blanking plates, carried on the front of the hull, over the engine compartment's air intake louvers, and the installment of infra-red driving equipment, including a searchlight. F72 AMX 30  In 1969 a single special dive training vehicle was adapted, nicknamed the AMX 30 Gloutte (from French faire glouglou, "gurgle"), without engine and tracks, that over a ramp could quickly be lowered into a reservoir by a winch; it was equipped with an escape tube.

HEAT is actually the standard ammunition of the 105 mm mle F1 gun. F72 AMX 30  The APCR round is fake. F72 AMX 30 
* The HEAT round is considerably weaker than in reality, with 300 mm of penetration compared to the historical 400. F72 AMX 30 
* The HE round is considerably stronger than in reality, with 53 mm of penetration compared to the historical 26. F72 AMX 30 
* Historical smoke and illumination rounds are missing. F72 AMX 30 
* Due to the lack of multi-gun controls in World of Tanks, the coaxial 20 mm GIAT M693 autocannon is merely cosmetic. F72 AMX 30
