|InTheGame_pros= 

* Good accuracy, aimtime, gun handling, DPM and penetration
* Fires high velocity APCR as standard ammunition
* Great mobility, though slightly worse than the [[M41 Walker Bulldog]]
* Good gun depression and elevation
* Ideal crew trainer for all regular Chinese LTs (same crew slots, loader is also radio operator)

|InTheGame_cons= 

* Large size and low camouflage values for a light tank
* Low alpha damage 
* Very thin armor offers no real protection, very vulnerable to HE penetration


|InTheGame_performance= This is a worse Bulldog and also not better then the tier 8 Chinese light. Ch42 WalkerBulldog M41D  As a premium you get away with shooting some more APCR without hurting your credits, and such a thing is heavily recommended if you want to penetrate most enemies from the side or equal tier medium tanks from the front.
