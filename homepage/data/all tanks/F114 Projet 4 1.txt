|InTheGame_pros= 
* Good standard shell penetration and high alpha damage 
* Front of turret is well armored and sloped
* Good mobility
* Very low chance to be set on fire (10%)
* Upper frontal plate is very well sloped. F114 Projet 4 1  Side armor is thick enough for some sidescraping

|InTheGame_cons= 
* Long intra-clip reload of four seconds
* ''Very'' long reload time of nearly 40 seconds
* Joint lowest view range of all tier 9 mediums at 380 meters
* Very large lower glacis plate and overall poor hull armor

|InTheGame_performance= 
The Char performs as a mid to long range support vehicle. F114 Projet 4 1  The quick aimtime combined with the long intraclip reload makes sniping while fully aimed almost certain, and the good accuracy and good penetration makes sniping a possibility. F114 Projet 4 1  Be wary of missing or bouncing shots, as ammunition is not exactly endless. F114 Projet 4 1  The armor holds up against lower tiered tanks poorly aimed shots, but it is not something to be relied upon. F114 Projet 4 1  Be patient in this tank and wait for opportunities, as its fast enough to flank, but you can easily find yourself over-committed and caught loading. F114 Projet 4 1
