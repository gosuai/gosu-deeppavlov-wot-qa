|The FCM 36 is much like the [[Hotchkiss H35]] and [[D1]]. F50 FCM36 20t  Compared to other tier 2 tanks it lacks speed and mobility while having good armor. F50 FCM36 20t  Its thick and well sloped armor is immune to most autocannons. F50 FCM36 20t  Don't be afraid to lead a charge, although that rarely happens seeing as its so slow. F50 FCM36 20t  Please note that you will often be left behind at the start of the battle due to the speed. F50 FCM36 20t

|InTheGame_performance= 
The FCM 36 is more like a miniature heavy tank than it is a light. F50 FCM36 20t  It is sluggish even when fully upgraded seeing as the Berliet Ricardo engine only adds 14hp. F50 FCM36 20t  It receives the same gun selection as the H35, and should also mount the 25mm Canon Raccourci mle. F50 FCM36 20t  1934 because the 37mm SA38 lacks penetration. F50 FCM36 20t  The best way too play the FCM 36 is to support the weak spots in your teams line, as most tanks that you will find in those places can't penetrate you. F50 FCM36 20t  Try and make sure that you won't have too relocate too much BEFORE the game starts. F50 FCM36 20t  The FCM 36 is not very mobile and has a hard enough time making it to the frontlines. F50 FCM36 20t 

|InTheGame_research= 
* The only thing that carries over from the Renault FT is the 25 mm Raccourci mle. F50 FCM36 20t  1934 gun. F50 FCM36 20t  Mount it immediately. F50 FCM36 20t  
* Next research both the Berliet ACRO and Berliet Ricardo engines. F50 FCM36 20t  
* After that, research the ER 54 radio so you can get a better idea of what's going on around you. F50 FCM36 20t 
* Go from there. F50 FCM36 20t
