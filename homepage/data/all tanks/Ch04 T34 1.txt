* Low ammo capacity with the top gun (34 rounds)
* Mediocre view range

*Once fully upgraded, the T-34-1's handling is very similar to that of the Type 59. Ch04 T34 1  It has very good maneuverability and speed on flat terrain, but its low engine power makes hill climbing a bit challenging. Ch04 T34 1  Together with the [[[[Tank:Cz05 T34 100|T34/100]]]] the T-34-1 possesses the second highest alpha damage of 250 among all tier 7 medium tanks, bested only by the [[A-44]], and combined with very good penetration of 175mm, the T-34-1 has no problem penetrating many tanks in its battle tier. Ch04 T34 1  If resorting to premium APCR ammunition, the 235mm penetrating projectile can easily go through most opponents in the right spot. Ch04 T34 1  However, its low accuracy and long aim time make it ineffective at long range and against tougher high Tier tanks. Ch04 T34 1  Since it only holds 34 shells, it is essential to make every shot count, something made even more necessary by the low rate of fire, which means that a missed shot can have serious consequences. Ch04 T34 1  Unlike the Type 59, the T-34-1 cannot mount a vertical stabilizer, so the Snap Shot and Smooth Ride crew skills are important for increasing this tank's overall gun handling. Ch04 T34 1 

*With the second turret, the T-34-1 is a multi-role vehicle. Ch04 T34 1  It does have the hp/t to flank targets, but thanks to the thick turret front, it can also go hull-down behind cover or even other tanks and prove itself a reliable roadblock, as well as act as a decent mid-long range sniper,  and the long aim time doesn't matter since you'll get plenty of time to aim while the gun reloads and you're in bush cover. Ch04 T34 1 

* It's effectively a highly mobile scout sniper, and despite what some might say, the mid-tier Chinese mediums are not brawlers. Ch04 T34 1  Your real strengths lie in being able to passive scout effectively, and quickly do a lot of damage to key enemy targets early on. Ch04 T34 1  Aim in fully using the camouflage, and the moment that you let the shot fly, get back to avoid damage and having to contest other tanks in a DPM war, a fight that you'll lose almost every time. Ch04 T34 1  Even if you do win against a lower Tier tank, you won't come out unscathed. Ch04 T34 1  The turret can bounce some shots, but your primary defense against getting shot is to use the camouflage and speed to not get shot in the first place. Ch04 T34 1  Learning to play this tank well in this fashion will greatly help with the [[T-34-2]] armed with a 122mm heavy tank cannon, as it's effectively a Tier 8 version with more accentuated strengths and weaknesses. Ch04 T34 1 

*The compact design of this tank is a pro and con. Ch04 T34 1  It's a pro in terms of you being a smaller target and can take cover more easily, but the con is that the compact design of the tank increases the chance of singular or more frequently, multiple module damage. Ch04 T34 1  The turret design allows for frequent ammo rack damage if shot from the sides which can be alleviated with a "Wet" Ammo Rack as well as Safe Stowage crew skill. Ch04 T34 1 

*Note: As of Update 1. Ch04 T34 1 10. Ch04 T34 1 1, the T-34-1 has been somewhat buffed. Ch04 T34 1  Previously, the dispersion was 0. Ch04 T34 1 40, the aim time 2. Ch04 T34 1 78, and the bloom on turret 0. Ch04 T34 1 15. Ch04 T34 1  Now, the dispersion is 0. Ch04 T34 1 38, the aim time 2. Ch04 T34 1 59, and the bloom on turret 0. Ch04 T34 1 13. Ch04 T34 1  This makes the gun more reliable overall. Ch04 T34 1   Lastly, the health pool has increased from 1,050 to 1,150. Ch04 T34 1 

|InTheGame_research=
*If you have unlocked the [[IS-2]], the top gun will be already available, but you can't mount it yet. Ch04 T34 1 
*The Tier 8 12150L engine carries over from the Type 58. Ch04 T34 1 
*The Tier 7 T-34-1 model 2 turret should be researched and mounted as soon as possible, as the upgraded armor and rounded slope of the turret will provide for some much needed defense. Ch04 T34 1  
*The upgraded suspension will be needed to mount the tier 7 100mm 44-100JT gun. Ch04 T34 1 
*Once you have the upgraded suspension get the 100mm gun as soon as possible as the significant boost in penetration as well as damage will allow this tank to show its true colors. Ch04 T34 1  
*Finally, research the tier 10 A-220A radio. Ch04 T34 1
