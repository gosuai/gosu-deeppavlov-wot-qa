{{TankData|Tank=Sturer_Emil

|The Sturer Emil is somewhat of a departure from the previous two German tank destroyers, the [[Tank:Pz. G43 Sturer Emil Sfl. G43 Sturer Emil  IVc|Pz. G43 Sturer Emil Sfl. G43 Sturer Emil  IVc]] and the [[Tank:Nashorn|Nashorn]]. G43 Sturer Emil  Unlike its predecessors, it has absolutely no problems with gun depression. G43 Sturer Emil  In fact, the gun depression is so amazing, it allows the use of tactics other tanks could only dream of. G43 Sturer Emil  However, it has a very low top speed and poor acceleration due to a measly, weak engine, making it a somewhat inflexible machine. G43 Sturer Emil  It also retains the very poor armor and large size of its predecessors, making it a vulnerable target. G43 Sturer Emil  Its top gun has extreme alpha damage and penetration for its tier, almost matching those of tier 9 heavy tanks, but it can only carry 15 rounds of ammunition. G43 Sturer Emil  If the driver of this tank is using this gun, they must be absolutely sure to make every shot count. G43 Sturer Emil  Beware - the Sturer's win rate is among the lowest in the game. G43 Sturer Emil  This is most likely due to the long grind to unlock the top gun. G43 Sturer Emil  The stock gun performs better than most other stock guns at this tier, although it will be mediocre in tier VIII and IX battles, as even the tank two tiers earlier has better penetration on its best gun.

|InTheGame_performance=
The Sturer Emil is a rather inflexible tank. G43 Sturer Emil   It is fragile, '''very slow''', and slow to turn. G43 Sturer Emil   Its open top and light armor means that it's very vulnerable to artillery. G43 Sturer Emil  However, this tank can excel by using its amazing gun depression on maps with hills and ridges. G43 Sturer Emil   It is best at peeking over the top of a rise, taking a shot with that awesome alpha, and then pulling back down out of sight. G43 Sturer Emil  If ridges are not available, the Sturer Emil can also play a traditional tank destroyer role and use its 370m view range to out-spot the enemy at extreme distances. G43 Sturer Emil  With its poor acceleration, slow rotation speed, and light armor, the Sturer Emil is not good at peek-a-boo around corners, nor at retreating if it is spotted. G43 Sturer Emil   On a city map it is often best to stay behind a line of heavies and '''carefully''' shoot over and around them as they move back and forth. G43 Sturer Emil   Use their armor to protect you as much as possible. G43 Sturer Emil  

The grind to the top gun is not fun. G43 Sturer Emil   The stock 105 mm, which is the same as the tier 6 premium TD [[Dicker Max]] lacks penetration and has neither good alpha damage nor high Damage per Minute, although the gun is good for a stock one at tier VII. G43 Sturer Emil   As a result, it requires the Sturer Emil to be exposed more often to deal damage. G43 Sturer Emil  This leads to an uncomfortable situation where the St Emil under performs in all departments: firepower, protection and maneuverability. G43 Sturer Emil  With the 128 mm top gun the alpha damage is great. G43 Sturer Emil   Getting to a place that you can inflict that damage is the challenge. G43 Sturer Emil  The more that you can leverage this tank destroyer's amazing gun depression, the better: hills are a Sturer Emil's best friend and should be relentlessly abused. G43 Sturer Emil  Maps with a lot of flanking and movement will be a trial, though. G43 Sturer Emil   Try to stay near friendlies who can keep you from being overrun. G43 Sturer Emil   Your primary job is to support your friendly tanks so they can keep you alive. G43 Sturer Emil 

The aim time on the 128 mm is an okay 2. G43 Sturer Emil 5 seconds. G43 Sturer Emil  With only 15 shells available you want to ensure that you hit with every one possible. G43 Sturer Emil  Don't underestimate the value of a 630 damage HE shell on the rare enemies that are too hard for you to penetrate. G43 Sturer Emil  Keep in mind that it only takes 2 or 3 hits for a reasonably good game. G43 Sturer Emil   Get 4 or more hits, and you'll be having fun!


|InTheGame_pros=
-The only tank in its tier to offer both huge alpha damage (490) and excellent penetration (231 mm) with its top gun

-Godlike -15 degrees of gun depression - coupled with the Dicker Max and FT AC for the best gun depression among all TDs in the game

-Good accuracy on both guns

-Excellent view range

-Very hard-hitting HE rounds

-12. G43 Sturer Emil 8cm's caliber is large enough to sometimes overmatch tanks

-Actually decent DPM for its tier relative to its caliber and damage
|InTheGame_cons=
-Poor armor, with almost none on the superstructure

-Terrible mobility: low top speed, acceleration and traverse speed, very vulnerable to flanking

-Big profile and bad camouflage values - relies on its view range for out-spotting

-Open-topped, vulnerable to artillery and high explosive shells - can't equip vents

-Very narrow and uneven gun arc (-5/7) coupled with only decent aim time

-On top of that, bad gun elevation of 10 degrees

-Atrocious shell count of 15 shells on the top gun

-No premium shells available on the top gun (although the penetration is almost always enough)

-Bad stock gun leading to a long, arduous grind

|InTheGame_performance= 
The Sturer Emil is known as a bad vehicle, largely due to the insanely long stock grind. G43 Sturer Emil  It does have some upsides, that make it not-so-terrible. G43 Sturer Emil 

In terms of firepower, this is basically its ace. G43 Sturer Emil  The alpha damage is a whopping 490, which was previously enough to oneshot many tier 5s before Update 1. G43 Sturer Emil 9 increased their health, but is still a huge hit to virtually anything (it is still more than a fifth of any tank's health it sees, unless it gets a horribly low roll). G43 Sturer Emil  The -15 gun depression also allows it to use several absurd spots almost no other tank can. G43 Sturer Emil  The penetration on this shell is 231, which is the 2nd highest for standard shell (literally 1mm behind the AMX AC 46 100mm with 232mm AP pen, although on that tank the 100mm is garbage so it might as well be the highest) but if premium shells are included, the Sturer Emil has the 25th highest penetration for a TD at the tier, but it still works very well. G43 Sturer Emil  It mostly will struggle against Russian turrets and certain very well armored tanks such as the [[T95]] or [[Object 252U Defender]]. G43 Sturer Emil  However, it does have a good DPM for such a caliber and damage per shot at tier, at about 2,222. G43 Sturer Emil 

In terms of survivability, there is no survivability. G43 Sturer Emil  The Health is low for a large vehicle (850) and has a rather low camouflage value. G43 Sturer Emil  On top of this, it has very poor armor (low enough for 150mm+ HE to penetrate and possible oneshot), leaving it with very bad survivability. G43 Sturer Emil 

The mobility does not help at all; although the traverse speed is somewhat decent, the top speed is terrible (25 km/h) along with sub 10 hp/t. G43 Sturer Emil  This leaves it as very sluggish, and prevents it from really having a decent upside that isn't the gun. G43 Sturer Emil  It also makes it horribly vulnerable to flanking, especially when combined with the extremely narrow gun arc. G43 Sturer Emil 

On the bright side, it does have a decent 370 view range, which partially negates the camouflage disadvantage. G43 Sturer Emil 

When played right, the Sturer Emil can perform right, but it does not have any real upsides apart from the gun - it is in a desperate need of a buff, either to mobility or camouflage, or both. G43 Sturer Emil

*Nothing carries over from the Nashorn. G43 Sturer Emil  You might have the radios unlocked from other German tanks, but the gun and engine are unique to the Sturer Emil. G43 Sturer Emil
