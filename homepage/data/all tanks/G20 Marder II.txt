|It is a vast improvement over the [[Panzerjäger I]]. G20 Marder II  It has a great penetration and damage with its cannons, especially the 7,5 cm PaK 40/2 L/46, which can hurt all other vehicles one or two tiers higher, even able to penetrate a KV-1 up front when hitting weaker spots. G20 Marder II  With more engine power and a better gun than the Panzerjäger I, the Marder II is a decent tank to play whilst heading further up the tank destroyers line, a few players even keep the tank after they have finished researching it, though it is important to remember that although the guns have great damage and penetration, they fall short in terms of rate of fire and aim time, but with patience the Marder can lay waste to its enemies.

|InTheGame_pros=
* Excellent penetration and damage
* As long as it stays still and behind several shrubs, it is a very sneaky vehicle
* Huge gun arc - Especially on the right side. G20 Marder II 

|InTheGame_cons=
* Feeble armor on gun shield
* Horrible aiming time
* Abhorrent accuracy
* Sluggish traverse speed
* Huge reticle bloom

The Marder II is essentially a downgraded Marder 38T shoehorned into tier three. G20 Marder II  The Marder II suffers from very poor gun handling even though both vehicles use the same Pak 40 gun. G20 Marder II  It is ill-advised to engage in close quarters as its low HP and poor armor may result in a quick death. G20 Marder II  Keep in mind that the tank's open-top crew compartment has virtually no armor, making it extremely vulnerable to howitzers, autocannons and semi-automatic cannons. G20 Marder II 

It is recommended to equip the Binocular Telescope to enhance its view range, which can be key to winning in small maps such as [[Province]]. G20 Marder II  Curiously, what is essentially the same gun on the [[FCM36 PaK40]] has significantly better rate of fire, accuracy and aim time than the 7,5 cm PaK 40/2 L/46 on the Marder II, with the increased penetration on the Marder only partially compensating for these drawbacks. G20 Marder II  And with its low rate of fire and small ammo capacity, precise aiming is an absolute must as missing a shot in battle could prove costly. G20 Marder II

* The FuG 5 radio is the only thing that carries over from the Panzerjager I. G20 Marder II  Install it immediately. G20 Marder II 
* First research the Maybach HL 62 TRM engine. G20 Marder II 
* Next research the upgraded suspension. G20 Marder II 
* Now you can research the 7,5 cm PaK 40/2 gun. G20 Marder II 
* You may now unlock the top gun or just go for the Hetzer, whichever you prefer. G20 Marder II

|History=
The Marder II was a German tank destroyer of World War II based on the Panzer II chassis. G20 Marder II 
== History ==
During the very first days of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Germans were shocked to encounter Soviet T-34 medium tanks and KV heavy tanks. G20 Marder II  Although the Wehrmacht succeeded in most operations due to superior tactics, morale, and supply, it had few anti-tank weapons capable of successfully engaging these vehicles at normal ranges. G20 Marder II  An urgent need arose for a more mobile and powerful anti-tank weapon than the existing towed anti-tank guns or tank destroyers like the Panzerjäger I. G20 Marder II 

Among a series of solutions, it was decided to use light tanks like the Panzer II and captured vehicles like the Lorraine Schlepper as the basis for makeshift tank destroyers. G20 Marder II  The result was the Marder series, which were armed with either the new 7. G20 Marder II 5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank guns or captured Soviet 7. G20 Marder II 62 cm F-22 Model 1936 field guns, large numbers of which had been acquired early in the war. G20 Marder II 
== Production ==
The Marder II came in two major versions. G20 Marder II  The first version Marder II (Sd. G20 Marder II Kfz. G20 Marder II  132) was based on the light Panzer II Ausf. G20 Marder II  D/E and Flammpanzer II chassis with Christie suspension. G20 Marder II  It was armed with captured Soviet 7. G20 Marder II 62 cm guns, re-chambered to accept German 7. G20 Marder II 5 cm Pak 40 ammunition, which improved its penetrative capabilities. G20 Marder II  These early Marder IIs had a very high silhouette (2. G20 Marder II 60 m high), thin armor of only 30 mm (front) and 10 to 15 mm (sides). G20 Marder II  There was no armour on the top or rear, leaving the crew with very little protection. G20 Marder II  Alkett and Wegmann produced 201 Marder II (Sd. G20 Marder II  Kfz. G20 Marder II  132) from early 1942 to early 1943. G20 Marder II 

The second version Marder II (Sd. G20 Marder II Kfz. G20 Marder II  131) was based on Panzer II Ausf. G20 Marder II  A to C removed from active service but later also newly produced Ausf. G20 Marder II  F chassis were used. G20 Marder II  This Marder II had a redesigned (widened) fighting compartment and used the German 75 mm Pak 40 anti-tank gun. G20 Marder II  The silhouette was lowered by about 40 cm to 2. G20 Marder II 20 m, but the armor was thin and the compartment was open to the top and rear, as in Sd. G20 Marder II  Kfz. G20 Marder II  132. G20 Marder II  FAMO, MAN and Daimler-Benz produced 576 Marder II (Sd. G20 Marder II Kfz. G20 Marder II  131) conversions from June 1942 to Mid 1943. G20 Marder II  75 more were converted (probably by FAMO only) from mid 1943 to early 1944 when the last Panzer IIs were taken out of active service. G20 Marder II 
== Combat history ==
The various Marder IIs fought on all fronts of the war, mainly at the Eastern Front. G20 Marder II 

The Marder IIs were used by the Panzerjäger Abteilungen of the Panzer divisions of both the Wehrmacht and the Waffen SS, as well as several Luftwaffe units. G20 Marder II 

The Marder's weaknesses were mainly related to survivability. G20 Marder II  The combination of a high silhouette and open-top fighting compartment made them vulnerable to indirect artillery fire, shrapnel, and grenades. G20 Marder II  The armor was also quite thin, making them vulnerable to enemy tanks or infantry. G20 Marder II 

The Marders were not assault vehicles or tank substitutes; the open top meant that operations in urban areas or other close-combat situations were very risky. G20 Marder II  They were best employed in defensive or overwatch roles. G20 Marder II  Despite their weaknesses they were much more effective than the towed antitank guns they replaced. G20 Marder II 

|HistAcc=
The 7,62 cm Pak 36 (r) gun was actually fitted to the early version of the Marder II, the Sd. G20 Marder II Kfz 132, which had a different fighting compartment and tall silhouette. G20 Marder II  This vehicle does not exist in the game. G20 Marder II 
* Uses the same Pak 40 gun as the [[FCM 36 Pak 40]] (which is actually a Marder I), yet their penetration values are inconsistent and the shells are incompatible with each other. G20 Marder II
