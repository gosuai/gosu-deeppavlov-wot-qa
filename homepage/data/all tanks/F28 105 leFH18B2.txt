It is the first premium self-propelled gun to be added into the game. F28 105 leFH18B2   Overall it can be compared to the [[AMX 13 105 AM mle. F28 105 leFH18B2  50]], since its gun has about the same damage, accuracy, and range. F28 105 leFH18B2   It makes a valuable addition to firepower on public matches but still loses against opponents like the [[Grille]] for its unmatched accuracy and damage. F28 105 leFH18B2   Many players will feel right at home using this equipment as it can be very forgiving. F28 105 leFH18B2   Its relatively thick armour is able to bounce shots from low tier guns, giving it a better defense against light tanks. F28 105 leFH18B2   The leFH18B2 also weighs in at almost 33 tons, allowing it to destroy light tanks that attempt to ram it. F28 105 leFH18B2 

This tank has kept the damage and penetration from before version 9. F28 105 leFH18B2 18, making it arguably the most powerful artillery tier-for-tier in the game -- even more so after 9. F28 105 leFH18B2 18 -- assuming it hits its target. F28 105 leFH18B2   The low splash radius and time to land can be frustrating for players and necessitates that you fully aim shots.

This tank was removed from the in-game store in the 8. F28 105 leFH18B2 6 update.

The 105 leFH18B2 has gun elevation and depression which enables it to fire behind some rocks and small buildings and will greatly help in self defense when needed. F28 105 leFH18B2   It has the thickest armour of all artillery for its tier, making an exceptionally difficult target to kill by low tier scouts that do not stop and aim at the weaker armoured superstructure, although, just like the [[B1]] this SPG can be crippled by aiming at the exposed tracks depriving it of movement, but it will take several shots to actually destroy it. F28 105 leFH18B2 
A side effect of its strong armour is that it is nearly impossible to destroy by ramming by lighter vehicles. F28 105 leFH18B2   Light tanks that attempt to do so will instead destroy themselves. F28 105 leFH18B2 

The 105 leFH18B2 does not share the agility or speed of the [[B1]], so relocation and placement can be a problem and has a rather large silhouette in comparison to other SPG's of the same tier, but it can still make good use of the camo net. F28 105 leFH18B2 

It has an impressive view range (fully trained crew with BIA and coated optics can exceed 445m even on the move) which can be exploited to use it as a tank destroyer in combination with binoculars, but this should be done only in emergency situations. F28 105 leFH18B2   Keeping a few HEAT rounds for more consistent damage to use in self defense in shotgun mode can be useful. F28 105 leFH18B2   It can be very threatening to targets that get too close to you. F28 105 leFH18B2 

Hitting small targets can be difficult due to the lack of HE splash damage, just like the [[AMX 13 105 AM mle. F28 105 leFH18B2  50]]. F28 105 leFH18B2   However its insane rate of fire means you will have multiple opportunities as long as they stay spotted. F28 105 leFH18B2 

While the leFH18B2 does have the lowest damage per shot of its tier it also has the fastest rate of fire for its tier by a decent margin, which makes up for the lack of splash damage. F28 105 leFH18B2 

Note that this vehicle cannot stun due to the low caliber of the gun, but unlike most arty retains the ability to fire both AP and HEAT (Premium ammo). F28 105 leFH18B2
