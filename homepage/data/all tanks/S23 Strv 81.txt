|History= 
At the end of the Second World War, it was clear that the mix of tanks in service with the Swedish Armed Forces was not just obsolete but also presented a large logistical problem. S23 Strv 81  Kungliga Arméförvaltningens Tygavdelning (KAFT, the weapons bureau of the army administrative service) conducted a study that concluded that the most cost-effective alternative would be to purchase the newly developed Centurion Mk 3, which, while quite modern, was judged to also have upgrade potential for future requirements. S23 Strv 81  A purchase request was sent to Great Britain, but the reply was that no deliveries could be made before the needs of the British Army had been satisfied, which was deemed to take between five and 15 years. S23 Strv 81  Thus, in 1951, the vehicle bureau of KAFT was set to develop a Swedish alternative project, E M I L. S23 Strv 81  Parallel with this, negotiations were initiated with France about buying the AMX-13. S23 Strv 81 <br />
The British stance altered in early December 1952, due to the economic necessity of increasing exports to earn scarce foreign currency. S23 Strv 81  Britain offered to sell the desired Centurions immediately. S23 Strv 81  Minister of Defence Torsten Nilsson arbitrarily placed an order of 80 Mk III around new year 1952/1953, with the first delivery in April 1953. S23 Strv 81  A few years later, Sweden ordered a batch of 160 Centurion Mk Vs, followed by a batch of 110 Centurion Mk Xs around 1960. S23 Strv 81  The Centurions, together with the Stridsvagn 103, formed the backbone of the Swedish armoured brigades for several decades. S23 Strv 81  The Mk IIIs and the Mk Vs were upgraded with a 105mm gun in the 1960s. S23 Strv 81 <br />
Between 1983 and 1987, the Centurions had a midlife renovation and modification (REMO) done, which included among other things night vision equipment, targeting systems, laser range finders, improved gun stabilisation, thermal sleeves on the barrel and exhaust pipes and reactive armour developed by the Swedish FFV Ordnance. S23 Strv 81 <br />
The Swedish Army gradually phased out its Centurions and Strv 103 during the 1990s as a consequence of comparative tests of the T-72, Leclerc, M1A1 and Leopard 2. S23 Strv 81  They were replaced with the Stridsvagn 121. S23 Strv 81
