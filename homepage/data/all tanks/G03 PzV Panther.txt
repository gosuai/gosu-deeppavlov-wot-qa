|Upon reaching the Panther, you will quickly find that the inherited sniper playstyle still applies. G03 PzV Panther  At stock, the Panther is armed with the 7. G03 PzV Panther 5 cm KwK 42 L/70 which, although a bit low on damage, has sufficient penetration and accuracy for its tier. G03 PzV Panther  Its lack of firepower, added to the weak hull sides, make this tank an easy victim in firefights. G03 PzV Panther  Once the Panther is fully upgraded and sporting the long, accurate 7. G03 PzV Panther 5 cm KwK 45 L/100, it's one of the best sniping tanks in tier. G03 PzV Panther  While it has a low damage totals, and a fairly slow rate of fire for a 75mm gun, it can penetrate virtually all lower tier tanks from any range, as well as higher tier opponents with well aimed shots. G03 PzV Panther  The Panther shines as an excellent mobile-sniper, but as top tier can contribute on the front lines as well. G03 PzV Panther

The Panther is a basically the VK 30. G03 PzV Panther 02(M) with more health and a better sniping gun. G03 PzV Panther  One thing that changes from the stock panther turret is the shot trap on the VK 30. G03 PzV Panther 02(M) turret was blocked with a small plate below the mantlet. G03 PzV Panther  Coupled with its speed and highly accurate guns it turns into a very deadly sniper. G03 PzV Panther  Take on your foes from a distance in the Panther as the more maneuverable American and Soviet mediums are better suited to dog-fighting. G03 PzV Panther  The Panther excels as a mobile sniper, especially with the 7,5cm L/100, and should not brawl as it does not quite have the maneuverability to effectively circle heavy tanks. G03 PzV Panther  Lower tiers will have trouble penetrating the front of the Panther due to its excellent sloping, and rather large gun mantlet (for both turrets), however it should avoid taking hits from more powerful guns as it is more prone than usual to taking critical hits, especially engine and ammo rack. G03 PzV Panther 

Its armor, while fairly thin, is surprisingly strong against tier V and some tier VI guns, so, if necessary, angle the tank just slightly off to one side, and bounce many hits. G03 PzV Panther   Still, do not rely on the armor, as 85mm is still not enough to reliably stop any 150 or more pen gun regardless of angling, nor is the lower glasis anywhere near the levels of the upper section. G03 PzV Panther   Hulldown with the 2nd turret is extremely effective with the 8. G03 PzV Panther 8 depression buff, and while its no American tank, it can still hull down and take some hits to its fairly small turret (which is not only bouncy at long range, but has a somewhat trollish mantlet that eats shells, not to mention the schmalturm is quite a small target, making tanks with less accurate guns such as the long 122mm cannon, almost impossible to hit said turret past 400m. G03 PzV Panther 

Mobility post 8. G03 PzV Panther 8 is not the best but then again, the tank is not a  brawler nor a true flanker, meaning for simple relocating or the occasional flanking move, it is adequate. G03 PzV Panther   Take note that with the 8. G03 PzV Panther 8 "rebalance", the panther has very bad hill climbing characteristics, making speeds of 30 about the maximum that can be achieved going up a medium hill, and speeds as low as 15-20 for steeper hills or cliffs. G03 PzV Panther   Still, downhill speed is as high as 60km/hr and flat terrain can see speeds of about 50km/hr if one gives enough time to accelerate to speed. G03 PzV Panther 

The things one should avoid while playing any panther (specifically this tank but also applies to the VK 30. G03 PzV Panther 02(m) and Panther II) are any type of brawling, trading fire with any tank especially when not at the top of the list, leading the attack, and circling targets like other mediums often do (can be done to a few select tanks but, due to sub par turn rate and low speed maneuverability, should be avoided by less experienced players that do not know the exact timing to execute the maneuver). G03 PzV Panther   There is one brawling tactic that may work but is again risky and should only be done in self defense; facehugging an enemy can be successful due to the angles increasing and the enemy being denied any good shots at the lower glasis plate. G03 PzV Panther   Just be advised what the opponent is and most of all make sure every single of your rounds connects or the great 8. G03 PzV Panther 8 patch DPM will not get you out alive (hitting weakspots at point blank range is no problem, and with it even the strongest turrets can be penetrated with careful shooting to cupolas or hatches). G03 PzV Panther 

The recommended way to use this tank is, like its predecessor, is to hang back and take a supporting position. G03 PzV Panther  Unlike the [[VK 30. G03 PzV Panther 02 (M)]] however, the Panther is much more dangerous as a sniper because of the final L/100 gun. G03 PzV Panther  The L/100 offers consistent penetration and can stack up a serious amount of damage if you keep the Panther out of harm's way. G03 PzV Panther  While the alpha damage per shot is not particularly threatening, the rate of fire and the accuracy of this gun lets the Panther deal a steady stream of damage to its victims. G03 PzV Panther  More often than not the Panther's victims fail to realize it was this tank that chipped-off most of their HP until it is too late. G03 PzV Panther  The Deadeye skill is particulary effective on the Panther; causing fires, injured/dead crewmen, and ammo-rack detonations a bit more often than most tanks. G03 PzV Panther 

According to many people it is one of the best, if not the best tier VII sniper tank in the entire game, due to the very high penetration (capable of going through many tier IX tanks without APCR), very good accuracy, good DPM (8. G03 PzV Panther 8 added a massive boost to rate of fire), and respectable mobility (allowing for decent relocation especially once the enemies get too close). G03 PzV Panther   Also as an added benefit this is one tank that perhaps never needs to have a single APCR round loaded at all, due to 198mm of penetration being overkill on anything that is not a tier VIII heavy or a tier IX tank. G03 PzV Panther  The only real downside to this gun is it has trouble knocking off tracks at any angle other than sideways; but with that said it is a minor inconvenience compared to everything else it is does well. G03 PzV Panther  

|InTheGame_research=
Your primary objective should be to aquire the 75mm L/100 long barreled gun. G03 PzV Panther   While mobility is very important for a medium, the panther, being a sniper tank, really cannot do much without the improved gun, so if only the L/70 is equipped, one may have a very hard time penetrating even many tier VII tanks, let alone tier IX which will occasionally appear. G03 PzV Panther 

The second turret can be saved for last; its benefits are a slight increase in view range, increased armor, and a boost to gun depression. G03 PzV Panther   Still, for those that find the Panther reasonable without the top engine, it is not a bad upgrade to get right after the L/100. G03 PzV Panther

Panther is the common name of a medium tank fielded by Nazi Germany in World War II. G03 PzV Panther  It served from mid-1943 to the end of the European war in 1945. G03 PzV Panther  It was intended as a counter to the T-34, and to replace the Panzer III and Panzer IV. G03 PzV Panther  While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it as well as the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. G03 PzV Panther  The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late-war and immediate post-war tank designs, and it is frequently regarded as one of the best tank designs of World War II. G03 PzV Panther 


The Panther tank was a compromise of various requirements. G03 PzV Panther  While sharing essentially the same engine as the Tiger I tank, it had better frontal armor, better gun penetration, was lighter overall and thus faster, and could handle rough terrain better than the Tiger. G03 PzV Panther  The trade-off was weaker side armor. G03 PzV Panther  The Panther proved to be deadly in open country and shooting from long range, but vulnerable to close-quarters combat. G03 PzV Panther  Also, the 75 mm gun fired a slightly-smaller shell than the Tiger's 88 mm gun, providing less high-explosive firepower against infantry, though it was still quite effective. G03 PzV Panther 


The Panther was also far cheaper to produce than the Tiger tanks, and only slightly more expensive than the Panzer IV, as its design came to fruition at the same time that the Reich Ministry of Armament and War Production was making great efforts to increase war production. G03 PzV Panther  Key elements of the Panther design, such as its armor, transmission and final drive, were compromises made specifically to improve production rates and address Germany's war shortages, whereas other elements such as its highly compact engine and its complex suspension system remained with their elegant but complicated engineering. G03 PzV Panther  The result was that Panther tank production was far higher than what was possible for the Tiger tanks, but not much higher than what had been accomplished with the Panzer IV. G03 PzV Panther  At the same time, the simplified final drive became the single major cause of breakdowns of the Panther tank, and was a problem that was never corrected. G03 PzV Panther 


The Panther tank arrived in 1943 at a crucial phase in World War II for Germany. G03 PzV Panther  Rushed into combat at the Battle of Kursk before its teething problems were corrected, the Panther tank would thereafter only be fighting outnumbered in Germany's steady retreat against the Allies for the remainder of World War II. G03 PzV Panther  Its success as a battlefield weapon was thus hampered by Germany's generally declining position in the war, with the loss of airpower protection by the Luftwaffe, the loss of fuel and training space, and the declining quality of tank crews. G03 PzV Panther  Nevertheless, the Panther tank demanded respect from the Allies, and its combat capabilities led directly to the introduction of heavier Allied tanks such as the Soviet IS-2 and the American M26 Pershing into the war. G03 PzV Panther 


==Design==
[[image:Panther-2. G03 PzV Panther jpg|thumb|200px|right|Panther tank on the marsh]]
The Panther was a direct response to the Soviet T-34 and KV-1 tanks. G03 PzV Panther  First encountered on 23 June 1941, the T-34 outclassed the existing Panzer III and IV. G03 PzV Panther  At the insistence of General Heinz Guderian, a special Panzerkommision was dispatched to the Eastern Front to assess the T-34. G03 PzV Panther  Among the features of the Soviet tank considered most significant were the sloping armor, which gave much improved shot deflection and also increased the effective armor thickness against penetration, the wide track, which improved mobility over soft ground, and the 76. G03 PzV Panther 2 mm gun, which had good armor penetration and fired an effective high explosive round. G03 PzV Panther  Daimler-Benz (DB) and Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg AG (MAN) were given the task of designing a new 30- to 35-ton tank, designated VK30. G03 PzV Panther 02, by April 1942 (apparently in time to be shown to Hitler for his birthday). G03 PzV Panther 

The DB design was a direct homage to the T-34. G03 PzV Panther  It resembled the T-34 hull and turret form. G03 PzV Panther  DB's design used a leaf spring suspension whereas the T-34 used coil springs. G03 PzV Panther  The DB turret was smaller than that of the MAN design and had a smaller turret ring, which was the result of the narrower hull required by the leaf spring suspension which lay outside of hull. G03 PzV Panther  The main advantages of the leaf springs over a torsion bar suspension were a lower hull silhouette and a simpler shock damping design. G03 PzV Panther  Like the T-34, the DB design had a rear drive sprocket. G03 PzV Panther  Unlike the T-34, the DB design had a three-man turret crew: commander, gunner, and loader. G03 PzV Panther  But as the planned L/70 75 mm gun was much longer and heavier than the T-34's, mounting it in the Daimler-Benz turret was difficult. G03 PzV Panther  Plans to reduce the turret crew to two men to stem this problem were eventually dropped. G03 PzV Panther 

The MAN design embodied more conventional German thinking with the transmission and drive sprocket in the front and a turret placed centrally on the hull. G03 PzV Panther  It had a gasoline engine and eight torsion-bar suspension axles per side. G03 PzV Panther  Because of the torsion bar suspension and the drive shaft running under the turret basket, the MAN Panther was higher and had a wider hull than the DB design. G03 PzV Panther  The slightly earlier, Henschel designed Tiger I heavy tank's use of a "slack-track" Christie-style pattern of large road wheels with no return rollers for the upper run of track, and with the main road wheels being overlapping and interleaved in layout, were design concepts broadly repeated with the MAN design for the Panther. G03 PzV Panther 

The two designs were reviewed over a period from January through March 1942. G03 PzV Panther  Reichminister Todt, and later, his replacement Albert Speer, both recommended the DB design to Hitler because of its several advantages over the initial MAN design. G03 PzV Panther  However, at the final submission, MAN improved their design, having learned from the DB proposal, and a review by a special commission appointed by Hitler in May 1942 ended up selecting the MAN design. G03 PzV Panther  Hitler approved this decision after reviewing it overnight. G03 PzV Panther  One of the principal reasons given for this decision was that the MAN design used an existing turret designed by Rheinmetall-Borsig, while the DB design would have required a brand new turret to be designed and produced, substantially delaying the commencement of production. G03 PzV Panther 

==Production== 
[[image:Panther assembly line in Germany. G03 PzV Panther jpg|thumb|160px|left|Panther assembly line in Germany]]
The MAN design also had better fording ability, easier gun servicing and higher mobility due to better suspension, wider tracks, and a bigger fuel tank. G03 PzV Panther  A mild steel prototype was produced by September 1942 and, after testing at Kummersdorf, was officially accepted. G03 PzV Panther  It was put into immediate production. G03 PzV Panther  The start of production was delayed, however, mainly because there were too few specialized machine tools needed for the machining of the hull. G03 PzV Panther  Finished tanks were produced in December and suffered from reliability problems as a result of this haste. G03 PzV Panther  The demand for this tank was so high that the manufacturing was soon expanded beyond MAN to include Daimler-Benz, Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen-Hannover (MNH) and Henschel & Sohn in Kassel. G03 PzV Panther 

The initial production target was 250 tanks per month at MAN. G03 PzV Panther  This was increased to 600 per month in January 1943. G03 PzV Panther  Despite determined efforts, this figure was never reached due to disruption by Allied bombing, manufacturing bottlenecks, and other difficulties. G03 PzV Panther  Production in 1943 averaged 148 per month. G03 PzV Panther  In 1944, it averaged 315 a month (3,777 having been built that year), peaking with 380 in July and ending around the end of March 1945, with at least 6,000 built in total. G03 PzV Panther  Front-line combat strength peaked on 1 September 1944 at 2,304 tanks, but that same month a record number of 692 tanks were reported lost. G03 PzV Panther 

Allied bombing was first directed at the common choke-point for both Panther and Tiger production, the Maybach engine plant. G03 PzV Panther  This was bombed the night of 27/28 April 1944 and production was shut down for five months. G03 PzV Panther  A second plant had already been planned, the Auto-Union plant at Siegmar, and this came online in May 1944. G03 PzV Panther  Targeting of Panther factories began with a bombing raid on the DB plant on 6 August 1944, and again on the night of 23/24 August. G03 PzV Panther  MAN was struck on 10 September, 3 October and 19 October 1944, and then again on 3 January and 20/21 February 1945. G03 PzV Panther  MNH was not attacked until 14 and 28 March 1945. G03 PzV Panther 

In addition to interfering with tank production goals, the bombing forced a steep drop in the production of spare parts. G03 PzV Panther  Spare parts as a percentage of tank production dropped from 25–30 percent in 1943, to 8 percent in the fall of 1944. G03 PzV Panther  This only compounded the problems with reliability and numbers of operational Panthers, as tanks in the field had to be cannibalized for parts. G03 PzV Panther 

==Cost==

One source has cited the cost of a Panther tank as 117,100 Reichmarks (RM). G03 PzV Panther  This compared with 82,500 RM for the StuG III, 96,163 RM for the Panzer III, 103,462 RM for the Panzer IV, and 250,800 RM for the Tiger I. G03 PzV Panther  These figures did not include the cost of the armament and radio. G03 PzV Panther  In terms of Reichmarks per ton, therefore, the Panther tank was one of the most cost-effective of the German AFV's of World War II. G03 PzV Panther  However, these cost figures should be understood in the context of the time period in which the various AFVs were first designed, as the Germans increasingly strove for designs and production methods that would allow for higher production rates, and thus steadily reduced the cost of their AFVs. G03 PzV Panther  For example, another source has cited the total cost of the early production Tiger I in 1942–1943 to be as high as 800,000 RM. G03 PzV Panther 

The process of streamlining the production of German AFVs first began after Speer became Reichminister in early 1942, and steadily accelerated through 1944; production of the Panther tank thus coincided with this period of increased manufacturing efficiency. G03 PzV Panther  German AFV manufacturers at the start of World War II utilized only heavily labor-intensive and costly manufacturing methods unsuitable for the needs of mass production; even with streamlined production methods, Germany never approached the efficiency of Allied manufacturing during World War II.

The first 250 Panthers were powered by a Maybach HL 210 P30 engine, V-12 gasoline engine which delivered 650 metric hp at 3,000 rpm and had three simple air filters. G03 PzV Panther [19] Starting in May 1943, the Panthers were built using the 700 PS (690 hp, 515 kW)/3000 rpm, 23. G03 PzV Panther 1 litre Maybach HL 230 P30 V-12 gasoline engine. G03 PzV Panther  The light alloy block used in the HL 210 was replaced by a cast iron block to save aluminum. G03 PzV Panther  Two multistage "cyclone" air filters were used to automate some of the dust removal process. G03 PzV Panther  In practice the engine power output was reduced due to the use of low quality gasoline. G03 PzV Panther  With a capacity of 190 US gallons of fuel, a Panther could operate 60–80 mi (97–130 km) on roads and 40–50 mi (64–80 km) cross country

The HL 230 P30 engine was a very compact design, which kept the space between the cylinder walls to a minimum. G03 PzV Panther  The crankshaft was composed of seven discs, each with an outer race of roller bearings, and a crankshaft pin between each disc. G03 PzV Panther  To reduce the length of the engine further, by one half a cylinder diameter, the two banks of 6 cylinders of the V-12 were not offset - the center points of the connecting rods of each cylinder pair in the "V" where they joined the crankshaft pin were thus at the same spot rather than offset; to accommodate this arrangement, one connecting rod in the pair of cylinders was forked and fit around the other "solid" connecting rod at the crankshaft pin. G03 PzV Panther  (A more typical "V" engine would have had offset cylinder banks and each pair of connecting rods would have fit simply side by side on the crankshaft pin). G03 PzV Panther  This compact arrangement with the connecting rods was the source of considerable teething problems early on. G03 PzV Panther  Blown head gaskets were another problem, which was corrected with improved seals in September 1943. G03 PzV Panther  Improved bearings were introduced in November 1943 to replace the faulty ones that had failed frequently. G03 PzV Panther  An engine governor was also added in November 1943 that reduced the maximum engine speed to 2500 rpm. G03 PzV Panther  An eighth crankshaft bearing was added beginning in January 1944 to help reduce motor failures. G03 PzV Panther 

The engine compartment space was designed to be watertight so that the Panther could be submerged and cross waterways. G03 PzV Panther  The result was that the engine compartment was poorly ventilated and prone to overheating. G03 PzV Panther  The fuel connectors in the early models were non-insulated, leading to leakage of fuel fumes into the engine compartment. G03 PzV Panther  This led to many engine fires in the early Panthers. G03 PzV Panther  Additional ventilation was added to draw off these gasses, which mitigated but did not completely solve the problem of engine fires. G03 PzV Panther  Other measures taken to reduce this problem included improving the coolant circulation inside the motor and adding a reinforced membrane spring to the fuel pump. G03 PzV Panther  The Panther had a solid firewall separating the engine compartment and the fighting compartment to keep engine fires from spreading. G03 PzV Panther 

The engine became more reliable over time. G03 PzV Panther  A French assessment of their stock of captured Panthers in 1947 concluded that the engine had an average life of 1,000 km (620 mi) and maximum life of 1,500 km (930 mi). G03 PzV Panther 

==Suspension==
[[image:Interleaved wheels on a Panther. G03 PzV Panther jpg|thumb|200px|right|Technicians doing maintenance works on maintenance demanding interleaving wheels suspension system]]
The suspension consisted of front drive sprockets, rear idlers and eight double-interleaved rubber-rimmed steel road wheels on each side, suspended on a dual torsion bar suspension. G03 PzV Panther  The dual torsion bar system, designed by Professor Ernst Lehr, allowed for a wide travel stroke and rapid oscillations with high reliability, thus allowing for relatively high speed travel by this heavy tank over undulating terrain. G03 PzV Panther  However, the extra space required for the bars running across the length of the bottom of the hull, below the turret basket, increased the overall height of the tank and also prevented an escape hatch in the hull bottom. G03 PzV Panther  When damaged by mines, the torsion bars often required a welding torch for removal. G03 PzV Panther 

The Panther's suspension was complicated to manufacture and the interleaved system made replacing inner road wheels time consuming. G03 PzV Panther  The interleaved wheels also had a tendency to become clogged with mud, rocks and ice, and could freeze solid overnight in the harsh winter weather of the Eastern Front. G03 PzV Panther  Shell damage could also cause the road wheels to jam together and become extremely difficult to separate. G03 PzV Panther  Interleaved wheels had long been standard on all German half-tracks. G03 PzV Panther  The extra wheels did provide better flotation and stability, and also provided more armor protection for the thin hull sides than smaller wheels or non-interleaved wheel systems, but the complexity meant that no other country ever adopted this design for their tanks. G03 PzV Panther  In September 1944, and again in March/April 1945, M. G03 PzV Panther A. G03 PzV Panther N. G03 PzV Panther  built a limited number of Panther tanks with steel roadwheels originally designed for the Tiger II and late series Tiger I tanks. G03 PzV Panther  Steel roadwheels were introduced from chassis number 121052 due to raw material constraints. G03 PzV Panther 

From November 1944 through February 1945, a conversion process began to use sleeve bearings in the Panther tank, as there was a shortage of ball bearings. G03 PzV Panther  The sleeve bearings were primarily used in the running gear; plans were made also to convert the transmission to sleeve bearings, but were not carried out as production of Panther tanks came to an end. G03 PzV Panther 

==Steering and transmission==
[[image:Panther field repairs Note the transmission exchange. G03 PzV Panther jpg|thumb|160px|left|Panther field repairs Note the transmission exchange]]
Steering was accomplished through a seven-speed AK 7-200 synchromesh gearbox, designed by Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen, and a MAN single radius steering system, operated by steering levers. G03 PzV Panther  Each gear had a fixed radius of turning, ranging from five meters for 1st gear up to 80 meters for 7th gear. G03 PzV Panther  The driver was expected to judge the sharpness of a turn ahead of time and shift into the appropriate gear to turn the tank. G03 PzV Panther  The driver could also engage the brakes on one side to force a sharper turn. G03 PzV Panther  This manual steering was a much simplified design, compared to the more sophisticated dual-radius hydraulically controlled steering system of the Tiger tanks. G03 PzV Panther 

The AK 7-200 transmission was also capable of pivot turns, but this method of turning could accelerate failures of the final drive. G03 PzV Panther 

Throughout its career, the weakest parts were its final drive units. G03 PzV Panther  The problems were from a combination of factors. G03 PzV Panther  The original MAN proposal had called for the Panther to have an epicyclic gearing (hollow spur) system in the final drive, similar to that used in the Tiger I. G03 PzV Panther  However, Germany at the time suffered from a shortage of gear-cutting machine tools and, unlike the Tiger tanks, the Panther was intended to be produced in large numbers. G03 PzV Panther  To achieve the goal of higher production rates, numerous simplifications were made to the design and its manufacture. G03 PzV Panther  This process was aggressively pushed forward, sometimes against the wishes of designers and army officers, by the Chief Director of Armament and War Production, Karl-Otto Saur (who worked under, and later succeeded, Reichminister Speer). G03 PzV Panther  Consequently, the final drive was changed to a double spur system. G03 PzV Panther  Although much simpler to produce, the double spur gears had inherently higher internal impact and stress loads, making them prone to failure under the high torque requirements of the heavy Panther tank. G03 PzV Panther  Furthermore, high quality steel intended for double spur system was not available for mass production, and was replaced by 37MnSi5 tempered steel, which was unsuitable for high-stress gear. G03 PzV Panther  In contrast, both the Tiger II and the US M4 Sherman tank had double helical (herringbone gears) in their final drives, a system that reduced internal stress loads and was less complex than epicyclic gears. G03 PzV Panther 

Compounding these problems was the fact that the final drive's housing and gear mountings were too weak because of the type of steel used and/or the tight space allotted for the final drive. G03 PzV Panther  The final gear mountings deformed easily under the high torque and stress loads, pushing the gears out of alignment and resulting in failure. G03 PzV Panther  Due to the weakness of the final drives their average fatigue life was only 150 km. G03 PzV Panther  In Normandy, about half of the abandoned Panthers were found by the French to have broken final drives. G03 PzV Panther  However, at least the final gear housing was eventually replaced with stronger one, while final gear problem was never solved. G03 PzV Panther 

Plans were made to replace the final drive, either with a version of the original epicyclic gears planned by MAN, or with the final drive of the Tiger II. G03 PzV Panther  These plans were intertwined with the planning for the Panther II, which never came to fruition because Panzer Commission deemed that temporary drop in production of Panther due to merger of Tiger II and Panther II was unacceptable. G03 PzV Panther  It was estimated that building the epicyclic gear final drive would have required 2. G03 PzV Panther 2 times more machining work than double spur gears, and this would have affected manufacturing output. G03 PzV Panther 

Most of the shortcomings were considered acceptable once design flaws were rectified. G03 PzV Panther  Due to the mechanical unreliability of final gear Panther must be driven with care, a characteristic shared with the Tiger tanks as well as Jagdtigers. G03 PzV Panther  Long road marches would result in a significant number of losses due to breakdowns, and so the German Army had to ship the tanks by rail as close to the battlefield as possible.

Lieutenant Colonel Wilson M. G03 PzV Panther  Hawkins of the 2nd AD wrote the following comparing the US M4 Sherman and German Panther in a report to Allied headquarters:

''"It has been claimed that our tank is the more maneuverable. G03 PzV Panther  In recent tests we put a captured German Mark V [Panther] against all models of our own. G03 PzV Panther  The German tank was the faster, both across country and on the highway and could make sharper turns. G03 PzV Panther  It was also the better hill climber"''

This was backed up in an interview with Technical Sergeant Willard D. G03 PzV Panther  May of the 2nd AD who commented:

''"I have taken instructions on the Mark V [Panther] and have found, first, it is easily as maneuverable as the Sherman; second the flotation exceeds that of the Sherman"''

Staff Sergeant and Tank Platoon Sergeant Charles A Carden completes the comparison in his report:

''"The Mark V [Panther] and IV [Tiger] in my opinion have more maneuverability and certainly more flotation. G03 PzV Panther  I have seen in many cases where the Mark V and VI tanks could maneuver nicely over ground where the M4 would bog down. G03 PzV Panther  On one occasion I saw at least 10 Royal Tigers [Tiger B] make a counter attack against us over ground that for us was nearly impassible"''

Initial production Panthers had a face-hardened glacis plate (the main front hull armor piece), but as armor-piercing capped rounds became the standard in all armies (thus defeating the benefits of face-hardening, which caused uncapped rounds to shatter), this requirement was deleted on March 30, 1943. G03 PzV Panther  By August 1943, Panthers were being built only with a homogeneous steel glacis plate. G03 PzV Panther  The front hull had 80 mm of armor sloped back at 55 degrees from the vertical, welded but also interlocked for strength. G03 PzV Panther  The combination of a steep slope and thick armor meant that few Allied or Soviet weapons could penetrate this part of the tank. G03 PzV Panther 

The armor for the side hull and superstructure (the side sponsons) was much thinner (40–50 mm). G03 PzV Panther  The thinner side armor was necessary to keep the overall weight within reasonable bounds, but it made the Panther vulnerable to attacks from the side by most Allied and Soviet tank and anti-tank guns. G03 PzV Panther  German tactical doctrine for the use of the Panther thus emphasized the importance of flank protection. G03 PzV Panther  Five millimeter thick skirt armor, known as Schürzen, intended to provide protection for the lower side hull from Soviet anti-tank rifle fire was fitted on the hull side. G03 PzV Panther  Zimmerit coating against magnetic mines started to be applied at the factory on late Ausf D models beginning in September 1943; an order for field units to apply Zimmerit to older versions of the Panther was issued in November 1943. G03 PzV Panther  In September 1944, orders to stop all application of Zimmerit were issued, based on rumors that hits on the Zimmerit had caused vehicle fires. G03 PzV Panther 

Panther crews were aware of the weak side armor and made unauthorized augmentations by hanging track links or spare roadwheels onto the turret and/or the hull sides. G03 PzV Panther  The rear hull top armor was only 16 mm thick, and had two radiator fans and four air intake louvres over the engine compartment that were vulnerable to strafing by aircraft. G03 PzV Panther 

As the war progressed, Germany was forced to reduce or no longer use certain critical alloy materials in the production of armor plate, such as nickel, tungsten, molybdenum, and manganese; this did result in lower impact resistance levels compared to earlier armor. G03 PzV Panther  Manganese from mines in the Ukraine ceased when the German Army lost control of this territory in February 1944. G03 PzV Panther  Allied bombers struck the Knabe mine in Norway and stopped a key source of molybdenum; other supplies from Finland and Japan were also cut off. G03 PzV Panther  The loss of molybdenum, and its replacement with other substitutes to maintain hardness, as well as a general loss of quality control resulted in an increased brittleness in German armor plate, which developed a tendency to fracture when struck with a shell. G03 PzV Panther  Testing by U. G03 PzV Panther S. G03 PzV Panther  Army officers in August 1944 in Isigny, France showed catastrophic cracking of the armor plate on two out of three Panthers examined. G03 PzV Panther 

==Armament==

The main gun was a 7. G03 PzV Panther 5 cm Rheinmetall-Borsig KwK 42 (L/70) with semi-automatic shell ejection and a supply of 79 rounds (82 on Ausf. G03 PzV Panther  G). G03 PzV Panther  The main gun used three different types of ammunition: APCBC-HE (Pzgr. G03 PzV Panther  39/42), HE (Sprgr. G03 PzV Panther  42) and APCR (Pzgr. G03 PzV Panther  40/42), the last of which was usually in short supply. G03 PzV Panther  While it was of only average caliber for its time, the Panther's gun was one of the most powerful tank guns of World War II, due to the large propellant charge and the long barrel, which gave it a very high muzzle velocity and excellent armor-piercing qualities. G03 PzV Panther  The flat trajectory also made hitting targets much easier, since accuracy was less sensitive to range. G03 PzV Panther  The Panther's 75 mm gun had more penetrating power than the main gun of the Tiger I heavy tank, the 8. G03 PzV Panther 8 cm KwK 36 L/56, although the larger 88 mm projectile might inflict more damage if it did penetrate. G03 PzV Panther 

The tank typically had two MG 34 machine guns of a specific version designed for use in armored combat vehicles featuring an armored barrel sleeve. G03 PzV Panther  An MG 34 machine gun was located co-axially with the main gun on the gun mantlet; an identical MG 34 was located on the glacis plate and fired by the radio operator. G03 PzV Panther  Initial Ausf. G03 PzV Panther  D and early Ausf. G03 PzV Panther  A models used a "letterbox" flap opening, through which the machine gun was fired. G03 PzV Panther [58] In later Ausf A and all Ausf G models (starting in late November-early December 1943), a ball mount in the glacis plate with a K. G03 PzV Panther Z. G03 PzV Panther F. G03 PzV Panther 2 machine gun sight was installed for the hull machine gun. G03 PzV Panther 

==Turret==
[[image:Panther turret interior. G03 PzV Panther jpg|thumb|200px|left|Panther turret interior. G03 PzV Panther ]] 
The front of the turret was a curved 100 mm thick cast armor mantlet. G03 PzV Panther  Its transverse-cylindrical shape meant that it was more likely to deflect shells, but the lower section created a shot trap. G03 PzV Panther  If a non-penetrating hit bounced downwards off its lower section, it could penetrate the thin forward hull roof armor, and plunge down into the front hull compartment. G03 PzV Panther  Penetrations of this nature could have catastrophic results, since the compartment housed the driver and radio operator sitting along both sides of the massive gearbox and steering unit; more importantly, four magazines containing main gun ammunition were located between the driver/radio operator seats and the turret, directly underneath the gun mantlet when the turret was facing forward. G03 PzV Panther 

From September 1944, a slightly redesigned mantlet with a flattened and much thicker lower "chin" design started to be fitted to Panther Ausf G models, the chin being intended to prevent such deflections. G03 PzV Panther  Conversion to the "chin" design was gradual, and Panthers continued to be produced to the end of the war with the rounded gun mantlet. G03 PzV Panther 

In most cases the Panther's gun mantlet could not be penetrated by the M4s 75 mm gun, the T-34s 76. G03 PzV Panther 2 mm gun, or the T-34-85s 85 mm gun. G03 PzV Panther  But it could be penetrated by well-aimed shots at 100 m by the 76mm M1A1 gun used on certain models of the M4, at 500 m by the Soviet A-19 122 mm gun on the IS-2 and at over 2500 yards (2286 m) by the British Ordnance QF 17 pounder using APDS ammunition. G03 PzV Panther  The side turret armor of 45 mm (1. G03 PzV Panther 8 in) was vulnerable to penetration at long range by almost all Allied tank guns, including the M4's 75 mm gun which could penetrate it at 1,500 m (0. G03 PzV Panther 93 mi). G03 PzV Panther  These were the main reasons for continued work on a redesigned Panther turret, the Schmalturm. G03 PzV Panther 

The Ausf A model introduced a new cast armor commander's cupola, replacing the more difficult to manufacture forged cupola. G03 PzV Panther  It featured a steel hoop to which a third MG 34 or either the coaxial or the bow machine gun could be mounted for use in the anti-aircraft role, though it was rare for this to be used in actual combat situations. G03 PzV Panther 

The first Panthers (Ausf D) had a hydraulic motor that could traverse the turret at a maximum rate of one complete revolution in one minute, independent of engine speed. G03 PzV Panther  This slow speed was improved in the Ausf A model with a hydraulic traverse that varied with engine speed; one full turn taking 46 seconds at an engine speed of 1,000 rpm but only 15 seconds if the engine was running at 3,000 rpm. G03 PzV Panther  This arrangement was a slight weakness, as traversing the Panther's turret rapidly onto a target required close coordination between the gunner and driver who had to run the engine to maximum speed. G03 PzV Panther  By comparison, the turret of the M4 Sherman turret traversed at up to 360 degrees in 15 seconds and was independent of engine speed, which gave it an advantage over the Panther in close-quarters combat. G03 PzV Panther  As usual for tanks of the period, a hand traverse wheel was provided for the Panther gunner to make fine adjustment of his aim. G03 PzV Panther 

==Further development==

After the Panther II project died, a more limited upgrade of the Panther was planned, centered around a re-designed turret. G03 PzV Panther  The Ausf F variant was slated for production in April 1945, but the war ended these plans. G03 PzV Panther 

The earliest known redesign of the turret was dated November 7, 1943 and featured a narrow gun mantlet behind a 120 mm (4. G03 PzV Panther 7 in) thick turret front plate. G03 PzV Panther  Another design drawing by Rheinmettall dated March 1, 1944 reduced the width of the turret front even further; this was the Turm-Panther (Schmale Blende) (Panther with narrow gun mantlet). G03 PzV Panther 

Several experimental Schmalturm (literally: "narrow turret") were built in 1944 with modified versions of the 75 mm KwK 42 L/70, which were given the designation of KwK 44/1. G03 PzV Panther  A few were captured and shipped back to the U. G03 PzV Panther S. G03 PzV Panther  and Britain. G03 PzV Panther  One is on display at the Bovington Tank Museum. G03 PzV Panther 

The Schmalturm had a much narrower front face of 120 mm (4. G03 PzV Panther 7 in) armor sloped at 20 degrees; side turret armor was increased to 60 mm (2. G03 PzV Panther 4 in) from 45 mm (1. G03 PzV Panther 8 in); roof turret armor increased to 40 mm (1. G03 PzV Panther 6 in) from 16 mm (0. G03 PzV Panther 63 in); and a bell shaped gun mantlet similar to that of the Tiger II was used. G03 PzV Panther  This increased armor protection also had a slight weight saving due to the overall smaller size of the turret. G03 PzV Panther 

The Panther Ausf F would have had the Schmalturm, with its better ballistic protection, and an extended front hull roof which was slightly thicker. G03 PzV Panther  The Ausf F's Schmalturm was to have a built-in stereoscopic rangefinder and lower weight than the original turrets. G03 PzV Panther  A number of Ausf F hulls were built at Daimler-Benz and Ruhrstahl-Hattingen steelworks; however there is no evidence that any completed Ausf F saw service before the end of the war. G03 PzV Panther 

Proposals to equip the Schmalturm with the 88mm KwK 43 L/71 were made from January through March 1945. G03 PzV Panther  These would have likely equipped future German tanks but none were built, as the war ended. G03 PzV Panther 

The Panther was the third most produced German armored fighting vehicle. G03 PzV Panther

* From February 1943, all German armoured vehicles were painted in dark yellow (dunkelgelb). G03 PzV Panther  The standard base colour was changed to dark green in November 1944. G03 PzV Panther  In World of Tanks, however, the Panther is in early Panzer Grey. G03 PzV Panther 
* Historical Sla. G03 PzV Panther 16 diesel engine with 750 hp is missing. G03 PzV Panther  According to various of sources such as ''Military Engineer and Amazing Porsche and Volkswagen Story'', the engines were tested with positive results. G03 PzV Panther  A diesel engine was mounted onto a Tiger II as a prototype built by Nibelungen Werke and went through testings in the spring of 1945, though results has not been found from this test. G03 PzV Panther  Further proposals also wanted the engine to be mounted in the [[Panther]] and [[Jagdtiger]] vehicles for increased power, but the war's constraint on supplies and Nazi Germany's capitulation resulted in the cancellation of these programs.
