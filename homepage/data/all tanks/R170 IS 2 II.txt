|InTheGame_pros=
* Fast salvo preparation time of 2 seconds
* Reliable guns
* Strong turret
* Decent gun depression (-8) for a Russian tank

|InTheGame_cons=
* Bad stock guns; underwhelming alpha for its tier
* Subpar hull armor
* Low alpha for its class
* Large target

|InTheGame_performance=
The IS-2-II is best described as a medium-heavy hybrid, while its mobility is not as good as a medium, its guns sure have the DPM and the alpha to support the heavies' advances. R170 IS 2 II  It's best used as a support heavy tank while the much beefier heavies advance, due to your underwhelming hull armor, your best bet is to seek cover behind other tanks, or find a place to hide your hull and stick your turret out due to the thickness of your turret armor. R170 IS 2 II
