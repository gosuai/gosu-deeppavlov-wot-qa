|InTheGame_pros=
* High rate of fire
* Massive ammo capacity
* Large gun sweep
* Great gun depression, especially for artillery
* After patch 9. GB78 Sexton I 18 Artillery balance, it is one of only two SPGs ingame capable of firing AP shells. GB78 Sexton I 

|InTheGame_cons=
* Low damage per shot
* Poor shell penetration (compared to pre-9. GB78 Sexton I 18 artillery but it cannot see tier V)
* Low XP generation limits training
* Crew positions do not match well with other British SPG's

|InTheGame_performance=  
This SPG is a lucky one, because it can fire AP, which is very nice. GB78 Sexton I  Downside is that the penetration is rather low (compared to pre-9. GB78 Sexton I 18 artilleries). GB78 Sexton I  This SPG has a very high ammo capacity, so it's very unlikely it will run out of ammo in battle. GB78 Sexton I  The mobility is okay, not very special. GB78 Sexton I  It is fast in a straight line, but has a rather wide turn radius. GB78 Sexton I  This SPG also isn't a good crew trainer, because the crew layout doesn't match other british SPG's. GB78 Sexton I  

Unfortunately, the damage is low. GB78 Sexton I  A good rate of fire makes up for this, but it can be annoying to see that you deal less damage to enemies. GB78 Sexton I  AP rounds aren't trustworthy either (cannot see tier V after 9. GB78 Sexton I 18 however). GB78 Sexton I  Choose slow light tanks and medium tanks as your priority targets, else damaging can be very difficult. GB78 Sexton I  Playstyle is very alike the style of the other tier 3 British SPG, the Sexton II. GB78 Sexton I  Use this knowledge, it can help very much. GB78 Sexton I  

Before playing, choose wisely between camo net and binocular telescopes. GB78 Sexton I  If you want to be sneaky in this tank use camonet, so you are longer unspotted before getting killed. GB78 Sexton I  You can also choose to take binoculars if you want to spot targets if you are alone or your team leaves you alone facing enemies. GB78 Sexton I  You can fire at them, because you are able to spot them slightly before they do to you. GB78 Sexton I

The 25pdr SP, tracked, Sexton was a self-propelled artillery vehicle of World War II, based on an American tank hull design, built by Canada for the British Army, and associated Commonwealth forces, and some of the other Allies. GB78 Sexton I  It was developed to give the British Army a mobile artillery gun using their Ordnance QF 25 ponder gun-howitzer. GB78 Sexton I  From 1943 it replaced the US built M7 Priest (US 105 mm guns on a M3 Lee tank chassis); these had replaced the British Bishop (25 pdr on Valentine tank chassis) which had been improvised in 1942. GB78 Sexton I 

==Development history==

In 1942, the US supplied enough M7 Priest self-propelled howitzers to equip a number of British Army artillery units in fighting in North Africa. GB78 Sexton I  The British found the Priest to be an excellent weapon, which gave artillery the same mobility as tank units. GB78 Sexton I  However, the Priest used the American 105 mm howitzer rather than the British equivalent, the QF 25 ponder gun-howitzer. GB78 Sexton I  Having to supply different ammunition for a few units complicated supply for the British Army. GB78 Sexton I  The US attempted to fit a 25 ponder to the M7 Priest - producing the T51 in mid 1942 - but the program suffered delays including the destruction of the gun mount on the prototype during the first live-firing exercises. GB78 Sexton I  US resources were not available for a vehicle solely for British use so Britain turned to Canada. GB78 Sexton I  The Canadian Army Engineering Design Branch through the Canadian government's Department of Munitions and Supply were asked to build a vehicle similar to the M7 on the Ram tank chassis. GB78 Sexton I  The Ram tank was a Canadian tank design that used the chassis of the American Medium Tank M3 as did the Priest. GB78 Sexton I  The Ram had been sidelined by a decision to standardize on the Sherman tank for British and Canadian units. GB78 Sexton I  A prototype was completed on 23 June 1942. GB78 Sexton I  Following trials in Canada, the Canadian government ordered 124 vehicles in three batches. GB78 Sexton I  The prototype was shipped to the United Kingdom in early 1943, where it underwent further trials; the vehicle was found to be highly satisfactory and was given the designation "Sexton" (after the religious custodian) in May 1943. GB78 Sexton I  The British government ordered 300 Sextons in the summer of 1943; however, these Sextons were to be built on Grizzly tank hulls (Canadian-built M4A1 Sherman tanks) instead of Ram tank hulls. GB78 Sexton I  The Ram-based Sexton was designated as the Sexton Mark I and the Grizzly-based Sexton was designated the Sexton Mark II. GB78 Sexton I  British orders for the Sexton II eventually totaled 2,026 vehicles. GB78 Sexton I 

Unlike the Ram, which was inferior operationally to the Sherman and never saw combat as a gun tank, the Sexton was successful. GB78 Sexton I  Between 1943 and 1945, the Montreal Locomotive Works manufactured a total of 2,150 Sextons for the use of both Canadian and British forces. GB78 Sexton I  The vehicle entered service in September 1943. GB78 Sexton I  The vehicles were first used in combat in Italy by the British Eighth Army. GB78 Sexton I  Later Sextons took part in the invasion of France and subsequent Battle of Normandy and the campaign in north-western Europe. GB78 Sexton I  During the D-day landings a number of Sextons were ordered to fire from their landing craft as they approached the beaches although the fire did not prove to be very accurate. GB78 Sexton I  In spite of its confused origins, the Sexton was a combination of proven parts and proved to be a successful design and remained in British service until 1956. GB78 Sexton I  In oppose to Germany, which often used its self-propelled guns (assault guns) in a front line direct fire role, Britain and Canada only used the Sexton for indirect supporting fire. GB78 Sexton I  They kept the Sextons well back from the front line and used forward observers to direct overwhelming fire on a target. GB78 Sexton I
