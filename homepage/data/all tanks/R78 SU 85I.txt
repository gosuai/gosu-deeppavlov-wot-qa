This tank has a decent gun for its tier, having one of the best DPM of all tier V TD's. R78 SU 85I  However, it is not terribly accurate.

R78 SU 85I  Because the gun is not reliable enough to fire at weakspots from long distances, it is advised to carry some APCR to deal with heavy armored tanks. R78 SU 85I
