|Despite the move to Tier 4 in 1. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV 9, the Cruiser IV is still an effective tank. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  This tank has excellent gun depression at 15 degrees, superior even to the M4 Sherman. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  While the QF 40 mm Mk. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  VI is no longer as effective as it was at Tier 3, it is still capable of doing quite a bit of damage to most tanks up to tier 4. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The QF Mk. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  VI gun fires its burst significantly slower than most other autocannons which can be somewhat disorienting, though the second shot is less prone to firing wildly off-course. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV 

Overall, while not as good as it was at Tier 3, this is still an effective tank and great fun to play with. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV

* Great power/weight ratio
* 15 degrees of gun depression
* QF 40 mm Mk. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  VI does good damage and is very accurate for an autocannon
* Very quick reload on the Bofors, allowing for you to easily change ammunition without penalty

|InTheGame_cons=
* Weak armour
* Sluggish hull traverse
* Top gun fires more slowly than most other autocannons; requires some practice to get it right
* Somewhat low top speed doesn't allow you to make the most of your great power/weight ratio, and it may be frustrating. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV

A step up in the world from the Cruiser III, the Cruiser IV is an up-armored version. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The 40 mm Pom Pom now fire 2-shot bursts and the new QF 40 mm Mk. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  VI [[Automatic Loader#Autocannon|auto-cannon]] is available, along with an improved engine. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  However, the hull traverse, especially at high speed, is just as sluggish as on the Cruiser III, so making tiny circles at high speed with this tank is virtually impossible. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  

Also, the QF auto-cannon has very unstable penetration, and will bounce many shots that you expect will penetrate, so make sure that you aim at the weak spots. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Sniping is negated by the relative inaccuracy of the 40mm Pom Pom, forcing the tank into Close Quarter Combat. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  It is recommended to upgrade the Pom Pom whenever possible. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV 

All this said, the QF 40mm Mk VI works very well for the role the Cruiser Mk. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  IV plays. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  For anyone experienced with medium tank tactics, this tank will feel very familiar. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  While it's not as sturdy as it used to be, it's still fast and maneuverable, and has a good gun that's well suited for flanking. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Being able to fire a 200-damage burst every 6 seconds allows you to put a lot of hurt on anyone at or below your own tier, and to flank and kill many Tier 5 and some Tier 6 tanks (although it's still best to leave more heavily armored enemies for your team). GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  While the Bofors is quite accurate, and can allow you to use its rather high DPM at a mid-range sniping setting, its penetration is somewhat lacking for this role. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  While no longer as deadly as it once was, this tank can still be effective, even in Tier 6 matches. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV

|History=
Cruiser, Mk IV (A13 Mk II) was a British cruiser tank of the Second World War. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  It followed directly on from the Cruiser Mk III (A13 Mk I) tank. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The first Mk IVs were Mk IIIs with extra armour fitted to the turret. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Later Mk IVAs were built with the complete extra armour. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The tank was used in France in 1940 and in the early part of the war in North Africa before being withdrawn from service. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV 

==Development history==

Britain became interested in fast tanks after observing the Soviet BT tanks during the 1936 Red Army maneuvers. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The BT was based on the revolutionary designs of American J. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Walter Christie, and so a team from Morris Motors was sent to the United States to purchase one of Christie's tanks, and also the rights to build more. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The tank purchased became known as the A13E1, and this was delivered in late 1936. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  However, the hull was too small and this led to a second British-built prototype being constructed. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  0The A13E2 was built to mount the turret of the Vickers designed Cruiser Tank MkI (A9). GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  This carried a 40 mm 2-pounder anti-tank gun and co-axial . GB59 Cruiser Mk IV 303 water-cooled Vickers machine gun. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The drive train was also revised, with the road wheels no longer powered - as a result the tank could not be driven on its wheels alone. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Better tracks were used, with rear-mounted drive sprockets; on trials over 40 mph was attained on these tracks, but later the speed was governed to 30 mph. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The armour basis of the A13E2 was 15 mm, in line with other pre-war fast tank designs. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV 

The A13E3 was the final trials model; this led to the production tank, the A13 MkI, Cruiser Tank Mk III, which entered production in 1939 at Nuffield Mechanization & Aero Limited, a munitions subsidiary of Morris Motors. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  An order for 65 tanks was placed; and at least 30 tanks completed when the War Office decided to build a new model with thicker armour. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The A13 MkII, Cruiser Tank Mk IV, had a maximum armour thickness of 30 mm, and faceted armour was mounted on the original turret's sides and rear. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  This gave the tank a far more modern appearance. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Some Mk III tanks were re-built to Mk IV standard while at the factory. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  In service, the . GB59 Cruiser Mk IV 303 Vickers machine gun gave constant trouble, and so the British Army decided to replace it with the 7. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV 92 mm BESA. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  All British tanks were to have their designs modified to mount the new weapon from early 1940. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  This led to the main production version, the A13 MkIIA, Cruiser Tank MkIVA. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  A few examples of this model were sent with the BEF to France, along with most of the earlier A13's so far produced. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  It is not known how many A13 MkIVA tanks were produced; numbers depending on source. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Between the Cruiser Mark III and Cruiser Mark IV, 665 were produced when production ended in 1941. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  English Electric, Leyland, and LMS Railway were also involved in A13 production. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV 

In France the A13 did not do well; this was mainly due to poor training as a result of its being rushed into service. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Many tanks shipped to France were in poor condition, some so new they had vital parts not yet installed. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  However, the A13 did much better in the deserts of North Africa, and coped with the conditions better than some other designs. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  It was fast, and its 2-pounder gun was a fine weapon against Italian and German tanks of this period. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  It stayed in contention as a battle tank until late 1941, when newer models of the Panzer IIIand Panzer IV appeared with thicker armour and larger guns. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  In North Africa it was the anti-tank gun which claimed the vast majority of British tanks lost in battle; German tanks accounted for few British losses, contrary to popular belief. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV 

The A13 MkIII, Cruiser Tank Mk V was a radical departure from the original A13 design and constituted a new tank. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Both hull and turret were redesigned, and it used a new flat-12 Meadows engine with radiators mounted in the front hull. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Named the Covenanter, it was built in large numbers, but was not battleworthy and was used only for training. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The A13 MkIIA was replaced by the A15 Crusader tank, which was similar to the Covenanter but used the original A13 engine. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV

==Combat history==

The Cruiser Mk IV and MkIVA, in small numbers (40?) saw service in France in 1940 with the 1st Armoured Division of the British Expeditionary Force. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Most were abandoned at Calais, and the few tanks that did see action were overwhelmed by the vastly superior German forces. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  From October 1940 the Cruiser Tank MkIVA was sent to North Africa, where it served alongside the older A9, Cruiser Tank MkI and A10 Cruiser Tank MkII. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The A13 was never available in sufficient numbers, and a typical Armoured Brigade would have a mix of slow (10-20 mph) A9 and A10 with faster (30-40 mph) A13 and Light Tank Mk VI (acting as cruiser tanks). GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  This gave tactical and logistical problems. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  However, the A13 was popular with its crews, and its only real drawback was the lack of a high-explosive shell for the 2-pounder. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  Like all British tanks of the period, it was vulnerable to anti-tank guns, which it had no way of countering except by short-range machine gun fire. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  The A13 was generally reliable, and the 2-pounder gun was adequate against all Axis tanks up to late 1941, when the A13 was retired. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV  It was replaced by the A15 Crusader tank, which was in essence an enlarged A13 with thicker armour. GB59 Cruiser Mk IV
