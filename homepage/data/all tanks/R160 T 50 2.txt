|InTheGame_pros= 
* Very high rate of fire
* Good premium APCR rounds
* Very good mobility - high top speed and acceleration
* Decent gun depression for a Soviet tank 
* Small profile and good camouflage values

|InTheGame_cons= 
* Low alpha damage and standard ammo penetration
* Small health pool and poor armor
* Poor crew trainer - the commander is also the radio operator
* Very expensive repair bill for a Tier 6 tank
* A "premium" in name only - makes credits like a regular techtree tank

The T-50-2 is a veteran of the good ol' days; an age where many of the in-game mechanics are still very well under-developed (and at most times abused). R160 T 50 2  With a top-speed of 65 kph, the T-50-2 is arguably one of the quickest tanks in the current tech-tree (The Pz I C being the fastest). R160 T 50 2  However it is a vehicle that was mostly seen by players before the 1. R160 T 50 2 07 patch, so naturally, the T-50-2 is only rewarded to accounts dating more than 4 years. R160 T 50 2 

The gun has pretty good DPS and penetration, but it's alpha is quite low for a Tier VI vehicle. R160 T 50 2  That's normally not the case due to how nimble this machine is. R160 T 50 2  While it has been toned down in some aspects, it is still a very potent Light Tank. R160 T 50 2  Players can expect to perform some daring drive-bys and even run rings around slower heavies, and constantly being a major headache where the turret traverse speeds can't keep up. R160 T 50 2 

Speed is your biggest strength as it has one of the lowest HP of its Tier, at 580. R160 T 50 2  Expect to be one-shotted by many Tier VI or higher guns so avoid driving into the crosshairs of a TD or Heavy. R160 T 50 2  It's also quite light and small meaning careless players may often drive over the foot of cliffs and end up tipping over in a rather embarrassing way. R160 T 50 2

Premium vehicle, comes elite in stock configuration. R160 T 50 2 

|InTheGame_equipment=
Coated Optics, Vents, Tank Gun Rammer, Binocular Telescope

Since this tank is the very definition and icon of active scouting, mount ''Optics'' and ''Vents'' so that you spot further all the time. R160 T 50 2 <br />
For players that favor combat-recon role more, utilizing a ''Gun Rammer'' would be wise. R160 T 50 2  Otherwise, have ''Binocs'' so that even when remaining stealth you can still control a large area by providing vision coverage. R160 T 50 2  Another viable option would be the ''ETB 1t Class'' if one would like to strengthen its suspension for rough situations. R160 T 50 2 <br />
It's also worth mentioning that T-50-2 is currently the sole exception among LTs above tier V, being '''NOT''' able to mount a VStab. R160 T 50 2  Whether this is intentional or forgotten legacy from simply copying the old T-50-2 data is not known. R160 T 50 2

|History=
After the Spanish civil war, Red army leadership found [[T-26]] tanks obsolete and ineffective, mostly due to their weak armor, therefore a development of a new tank was ordered. R160 T 50 2  Two factories joined the competition, the ''OKMO design bureau'' in the ''Factory No. R160 T 50 2  185 (S. R160 T 50 2 M. R160 T 50 2  Kirov)'' and ''Kirov Factory No. R160 T 50 2  100'', both located in Leningrad (the factories are often mistaken for each other because of very similar names). R160 T 50 2 

The project of ''OKMO'' in the ''Factory No. R160 T 50 2  185'' was known as ''Object 126'' or ''T-126 SP'', which later evolved into [[T-127]], and eventually led to the [[T-50]]. R160 T 50 2 
The competing ''Factory No. R160 T 50 2  100'' came up with project known as ''Object 211'', some sources name it ''"T-50-2"''. R160 T 50 2  It was made in 1941 under the leadership of A. R160 T 50 2  S. R160 T 50 2  Yermolayev. R160 T 50 2  ''Object 211'' was slightly similar to the ''T-126 SP'', it had 2x6 small wheels springed by torsions bars, but in comparison with the ''T-126 SP'', the wheels were differently-made, distance between two whells was different etc. R160 T 50 2  ''Object 211'' also had a differently shaped and angled front armor, longer hull, and differently designed turret with much lower commander's cupola. R160 T 50 2  The armament and engine unit remained the same. R160 T 50 2 

Unfortunately ''Object 211'' did not win the competition because it did not bring any expressive advantages in comparison with the ''T-126 SP'', it was only a little lighter. R160 T 50 2 

The only prototype was deployed in the defense of Leningrad where it was probably destroyed. R160 T 50 2
