{{TankData|Tank=Ferdinand
| Widely known in real life as "Elefant", it is a slow but powerful Tank destroyer, reasonably well-protected for its class, the Ferdinand can be an intimidating opponent & can utilize its armor to engage enemies more closely than most tank destroyers, assuming they are firing AP ammo. G37 Ferdinand  The Ferdinand's mantlet is extremely strong, but not invincible, & the rather big target silhouette means that you will have a lot harder time hiding than in the [[Jagdpanther]]. G37 Ferdinand  However, upgraded with the 12,8 cm PaK 44 L/55, you pack quite a lot more punch than the Jagdpanther, & will be able to terrorize tanks & support pretty much every tier [[Heavy Tanks|heavy tanks]] from distant positions. G37 Ferdinand  The Ferdinand should not be taken lightly as an opponent. G37 Ferdinand 

Many players compare this tank with its twin, the [[Jagdpanther II]] as it carries the same guns, but keep in mind the Ferdinand puts emphasis on raw armor thickness & survivability, allowing it to soak up hits more often, & take more shots. G37 Ferdinand   While being slower than the Jagdpanther II, it makes up with the very good gun traverse, superior gun arc as well as better gun depression, requiring to move much less than a Jagdpanther II when readjusting the aim against an enemy.

|InTheGame_pros=
* Thick frontal armor & great gun mantlet, useful when top tier. G37 Ferdinand 
* Very high HP for a TD since patch 9. G37 Ferdinand 13 (1500HP, equal in hitpoints to the IS-3). G37 Ferdinand 
* Superior gun depression and gun traverse arc than the Jagdpanther II
* Decent maneuverability once upgraded with top engine, only a bit behind [[Jagdpanther II]] power/weight ratio wise
* Has 2 loaders, allowing smooth transition to the JagdTiger

|InTheGame_cons=
* Absurdly underpowered stock engine makes the stock grind frustrating
* Big & boxy silhouette, extremely prone to flanking & sniping
* Terrible camoflauge values
* While reasonably thick, the front armor has practically no slope at all
* Inferior to Jagdpanther II in terms of mobility. G37 Ferdinand

With a front & superstructure bolstered with 200mm of armor, as well as its powerful top gun, this tank functions very well as a hull down sniper. G37 Ferdinand  Tier 6, 7, & even some tier 8 tanks are going to have some major problems penetrating you from the front, but your armor is no match for gold shells, especially of tier 9 & 10 tanks. G37 Ferdinand  You're not particularly fast, nor can you turn very quickly, thankfully however it is a bit more agile than the American T28 of the same tier, so it is not quite as easy to flank. G37 Ferdinand 

Unlike the Jagdpanther II, which promotes an Aggressive hit-and-run-like playstyle, the Ferdinand, with its mediocre top speed & rather poor (but not the worst when upgraded) hull traverse, promotes a brawler/Defensive playstyle (defensive especially when stock) like the American T40. G37 Ferdinand  However unlike the T40, the Ferdinand boasts thick frontal armor, all that a Ferdinand driver has to do is cover the lower glacis. G37 Ferdinand 

The 8,8 cm from the Jagdpanther proves very useful when top tier, as it does not suffer from a sluggish reload (it actually reloads pretty quickly & can give you a jump on unsuspecting players that peek out at you one too many times!), & is able to penetrate tier 6 tanks easily & will have little issue with tier 7s, the 8,8 cm & 10,5 cm will also not have much issue against most tier 8s, especially if weakspots are focused upon. G37 Ferdinand  The Alpha of the 8,8 cm is sufficient for the most part against tier 6, 7, & some tier 8 tanks as well, but if it does feel unsatisfactory, the 10,5 cm is an alternative option. G37 Ferdinand  However, the Jpanthers guns effectiveness are greatly hampered against tier 9s & are rendered nearly useless to the Ferdinand against tier 10s. G37 Ferdinand  This is not because the Jpanthers guns cannot penetrate tier 9s & 10s (which they actually ''can'' depending on the target tank. G37 Ferdinand ), but that the Ferdinand is too sluggish to get into a position where it can penetrate these tiers with them. G37 Ferdinand 


In synopsis:
When Top Tier (without the 12,8 cm gun):
* Pick a position from which can provide your Ferdinand not only good cover for the lower glacis, but also has a good view on a choke point. G37 Ferdinand  This will give you plenty of shot opportunities on enemy vehicles without having to relocate for a while (unless an arty can get a shot on you, even then you have enough hitpoints to take a few indirect hits. G37 Ferdinand )
* Use your hitpoints to overmatch enemies when necessary, but remember you are ''quite'' slow to turn, try to avoid face hugging distance bouts. G37 Ferdinand 
* The Ferdinand's armor gives it a distinct edge at medium and long range distance firefights, do not forget to use this to your advantage, but remember that the lower glacis is weak. G37 Ferdinand 

When not Top Tier (Without the 12,8 cm gun):
* Tier 9s (if fully upgraded) and especially tier 10s will have no trouble at all overpowering your armor, your best bet is to go to the front that will likely see more vulnerable targets. G37 Ferdinand 
* If that is not an option, keep your distance and wait for opportunities to present themselves, a tier 10 that exposes their side to your from your position can still be penetrated!
* As stated above, patience can be a virtue with the Ferdinand in these situations, wait for faster tanks to cross your line of fire or for them to expose themselves to a shot or two from your gun. G37 Ferdinand 

|InTheGame_research=
You will have unlocked the 10,5 cm K 18 L/52 gun on the [[Jagdpanther]]. G37 Ferdinand  If you have gone through the [[Tiger (P)]], you will also have unlocked the first engine upgrade. G37 Ferdinand  Ideally, you should mount both of these as soon as possible. G37 Ferdinand  However, mounting both will take you close to the weight limit of the stock suspension. G37 Ferdinand  The gun, in particular, will make it impossible to even mount a gun-rammmer. G37 Ferdinand  Therefore it is strongly advised to mount enhanced torsion-bars, or use xp to unlock the upgraded suspension. G37 Ferdinand  
* Once you have improved your suspension you should mount both the upgraded engine &/or the 10. G37 Ferdinand 5 cm gun, depending on which you have already unlocked (both if you played both lines) & mount the other as soon as you have the necessary experience. G37 Ferdinand  
* Soon enough you will find the 10,5 cm to be somewhat lacking for a tier VIII tank destroyer, so your priority should be acquiring the devastating & feared 12,8 cm PaK 44 L/55. G37 Ferdinand  It will dramatically improve your combat effectiveness. G37 Ferdinand 
* Engine upgrades should be considered your highest priority after you get the 12,8 cm gun . G37 Ferdinand  Ferdinand shares its engine upgrades with Tiger P & VK4502 (P) Ausf. G37 Ferdinand  A&B. G37 Ferdinand 
* Top of the line radio is shared with multitude of other German tanks. G37 Ferdinand

|History=
[[image:Ferdinand_Elefant_USA. G37 Ferdinand jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[https://en. G37 Ferdinand wikipedia. G37 Ferdinand org/wiki/United_States_Army_Ordnance_Museum The United States Army Ordnance Museum]]'s restored Elefant. G37 Ferdinand ]]
Elefant is the common name of a German tank-destroyer of World War II. G37 Ferdinand  The official German designation was Panzerjäger Tiger (P). G37 Ferdinand  The ordnance inventory designation was Sd. G37 Ferdinand  Kfz. G37 Ferdinand  184. G37 Ferdinand 

The Elefant (German "elephant") was a "Schwerer Panzerjäger" (heavy tank-destroyer) of the German Wehrmacht, initially built under the additional name Ferdinand, after their designer Ferdinand Porsche, before it was changed to Elefant. G37 Ferdinand 

== Development ==

The design evolved from cruder, improvised designs of 1941–42, as well as the later, but still defective, Marder designs. G37 Ferdinand  The chassis was created from the 90 Porsche Tiger I models already built with new tracks and an all-steel wheel arrangement. G37 Ferdinand  Suspension consisted of six twin bogies with longitudinal torsion bars. G37 Ferdinand  The engines were placed in the middle of the hull to give room for the armament at the rear in a simple, casemate-style box structure, with slightly sloped sides, on top of this chassis. G37 Ferdinand  The engines drove electric generators, which in turn powered electric motors connected to the rear sprockets. G37 Ferdinand  Porsche had experience in this form of petrol-electric transmission extending back to 1901, when he designed a car that used it. G37 Ferdinand 

The driver and radio operator were in a separate compartment at the front. G37 Ferdinand  Surprisingly, the "slack track" setup on the "Porsche Tiger" chassis, on which the Elefant vehicles are based, at first glance appears to have used two drive sprockets per track; where the frontmost wheel is sprocketed, just as the rear drive sprocket is, and the innermost surface of the front sprocket, nearest the hull, seems to have had a drum brake fitted to act as the track brake. G37 Ferdinand

The vehicle was fitted with an 88 mm Panzerabwehrkanone (PaK) 43/2 L/71 gun. G37 Ferdinand  The L/71 had originally been developed as a replacement for the famous 88 mm anti-aircraft gun that had been used against Allied tanks in the Western Desert Campaign, although it was never fielded as an anti-aircraft weapon. G37 Ferdinand  The L/71 had a much longer barrel than the L/56 Flak 18 and Flak 36 guns, which gave it a higher muzzle velocity. G37 Ferdinand  It also fired a different, longer cartridge. G37 Ferdinand  These improvements gave the 88 mm L/71 significantly improved armor penetration ability over the earlier 88 mm. G37 Ferdinand  As fitted, the gun was capable of only 25° traverse and a similarly limited elevation. G37 Ferdinand 

== Production ==

Porsche AG had manufactured about one hundred chassis for their proposed version of the Tiger tank, the "Porsche Tiger" in the Nibelungenwerk factory in Sankt Valentin, Austria, with both Henschel and Porsche chassis using the same Krupp-designed turret: the Henschel design having its turret more-or-less centrally located on its hull, with the Porsche design placing the turret much nearer the front of the superstructure. G37 Ferdinand  Since the competing Henschel Tiger design was chosen for production, the Porsche chassis' were no longer required for the Tiger tank project. G37 Ferdinand  It was therefore decided that the Porsche chassis' were to be used as the basis of a new heavy tank-destroyer, mounting Krupp's newly developed 88 mm Pak 43/2 anti-tank gun. G37 Ferdinand  This precise long-range weapon was supposed to take out enemy tanks before they reached their own range of effective fire. G37 Ferdinand  Ninety-one chassis were converted (chassis number 150010 to 150100). G37 Ferdinand 

The two Porsche air-cooled engines in each vehicle were replaced by two 300 hp Maybach HL 120 TRM engines powering two generators that drove two electric motors which, in turn, powered the drive sprockets. G37 Ferdinand  The electric motors also acted as the vehicle's steering unit. G37 Ferdinand  This so called "petro-electrical" drive delivered 0. G37 Ferdinand 11 km/l off road and 0. G37 Ferdinand 15 km/l on road at a maximum speed of 10 km/h off road and 30 km/h on road. G37 Ferdinand  Besides the high fuel consumption and the poor performance, the drive system was also maintenance-intensive: the sprockets, for example, had to be changed every 500 km. G37 Ferdinand 

Add-on armor of 100 mm was bolted to the front plates, increasing the plate's thickness to 200 millimeters and adding another 5 tons of weight. G37 Ferdinand  The large, fixed casemate-style housing for the gun and most of the vehicle's crew was mounted in the rear end of the vehicle. G37 Ferdinand  As the engines were placed in the middle, the radio operator and the driver were separated from the rest of the crew and could be addressed only through radio. G37 Ferdinand  The work was completed in just a few months from March to May 1943. G37 Ferdinand 

In September 1943, all surviving Ferdinands were recalled to be modified based on battle experience gained in the Battle of Kursk. G37 Ferdinand  During October and November 1943, 48 of the 50 surviving vehicles were modified by the addition of a ball-mounted MG 34 in the hull front (to improve anti-infantry ability), a commander's cupola (modified from the standard StuG III cupola) for improved vision, and the application of Zimmerit paste. G37 Ferdinand  This and other minor armor changes increased the weight from 65 to 70 t. G37 Ferdinand  These improved vehicles were then unofficially called Elefant, and this became the official name by Hitler's orders of May 1, 1944. G37 Ferdinand 

Five Bergepanzer Tiger (P) armored recovery vehicles were converted in Autumn 1943. G37 Ferdinand  Three from Tiger (P) prototypes, and two more from battle-damaged Ferdinands and not suitable for the Elefant modification. G37 Ferdinand 

== Usage ==
[[image:Ferdinand_Kubinka. G37 Ferdinand jpg|thumb|200px|right|Panzerjäger Tiger (P) Ferdinand (Sd. G37 Ferdinand Kfz. G37 Ferdinand  184), on display in [[https://en. G37 Ferdinand wikipedia. G37 Ferdinand org/wiki/Kubinka_Tank_Museum Kubinka]]. G37 Ferdinand ]]
The units were deployed at a company level, sometimes sub-divided into platoons, with infantry or tanks to protect the vulnerable flanks of the vehicles. G37 Ferdinand  On the attack, this Jagdpanzer was a first-strike vehicle, while in defense, they often comprised a mobile reserve used to blunt enemy tank assaults. G37 Ferdinand 

== Combat history ==

All but two of the 91 available Ferdinands were put to use in the Battle of Kursk, the first combat the Ferdinand saw. G37 Ferdinand  Although they destroyed many Russian tanks, they performed quite poorly in other respects. G37 Ferdinand  Within the first four days, nearly half of the vehicles were out of service, mostly due to technical problems and mine-damage to tracks and suspensions. G37 Ferdinand  Actual combat losses to direct Soviet action were very low as the Ferdinand's very thick armor protected it from almost all Soviet antitank weaponry. G37 Ferdinand  However, at this point in its development, the Ferdinand lacked a machine gun or any secondary armament, making it vulnerable to attack by infantry. G37 Ferdinand  Most total losses of the Ferdinand occurred during the Soviet counter-offensive after the Kursk offensive, as many damaged Ferdinands had to be abandoned as they were too heavy to tow and others were lost to mechanical breakdown during the retreat. G37 Ferdinand  The surviving vehicles saw further limited action on the Dniepr front during late 1943. G37 Ferdinand 

At this point they were recalled and modified at the works in Austria and received the name Elefant. G37 Ferdinand  While the modifications improved the vehicles, some problems could never be fully fixed. G37 Ferdinand  In 1944, Elefants served on the Italian front, but were rendered rather ineffective, as their weight of nearly 70 tons did not allow them to use most Italian roads and bridges. G37 Ferdinand  Due to a permanent lack of spare parts, most of the units were not destroyed in battle, but abandoned and blown up by their own crews. G37 Ferdinand  One company of Ferdinands saw action during the Soviet's January 1945 Vistula-Oder Offensive in Poland, and the very last surviving vehicles were in combat at Zossen during the Battle of Berlin. G37 Ferdinand 

The Ferdinand/Elefant might well have been the most successful tank destroyer employed during the war in kills per loss, reaching an average ratio of approximately 10:1. G37 Ferdinand  During the Battle of Kursk, the sPzJagAbt 653 claims to have knocked out 320 enemy tanks at the price of 13 Ferdinands. G37 Ferdinand  This impressive average ratio was due to its extreme firepower and protection, which gave it an enormous advantage when used in head-on combat or a static defensive role. G37 Ferdinand  However, poor mobility and mechanical unreliability greatly diminished its offensive capability. G37 Ferdinand
