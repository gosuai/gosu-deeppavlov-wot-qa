The M40/M43 has excellent mobility compared to the other hard hitters in tier 8, [[Tank:GW_Tiger_P|G. A37 M40M43 W. A37 M40M43  Tiger P. A37 M40M43 ]] and [[Tank:SU-14|SU-14-2]]. A37 M40M43  It is on the higher end for shell damage in its tier, with higher shell damage than the [[Tank:Lorraine155_51|Lorraine 155 51]] and [[Tank:GB79_FV206|FV207]], tied with the SU-14-2 and only outclassed by the G. A37 M40M43 W. A37 M40M43  Tiger P. A37 M40M43   However, it has lower mobility than the Lorraine 155 51 and FV207. A37 M40M43   Due to its high damage combined with adequate accuracy, reload, and good mobility when fully kitted out, the M40/43 is arguably the best tier 8 artillery piece, and thus sees Clan Wars use during events with a tier 8 cap. A37 M40M43   Brothers in Arms and Snap Shot are highly recommended crew skills to train. A37 M40M43   

|InTheGame_research=
* Both upgrade engines and both upgrade radios carry over from the M12 if researched there. A37 M40M43 
* The suspension upgrade is necessary to handle the weight of the top engine and gun. A37 M40M43 
* Research the 8 in howitzer ASAP
* Not necessarily tank research, but train "Brothers in Arms" and "Snap Shot" on your crew. A37 M40M43   these skills greatly help this artillery piece. A37 M40M43
