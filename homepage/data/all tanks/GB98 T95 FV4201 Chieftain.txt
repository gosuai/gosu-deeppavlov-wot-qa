* Outstanding gun, arguably the best 120mm currently in the game 
* Extremely well-armored turret and well angled upper glacis
* Very good top speed and acceleration for a heavy tank
* Great gun depression, can use most hull down positions
* Excellent viewrange at 410 metres base

|InTheGame_cons= 
* Not counting the upper glacis, the hull is poorly armored
* While small, there is a thinly armored cupola weakspot on top of the turret
* Health pool is on the low side for a Tier 10 heavy tank
* Priority target for artillery and large caliber HE shells, especially when hulldown
* Worse DPM, accuracy, aim time and hull armor than techtree counterpart [[Super Conqueror]]
