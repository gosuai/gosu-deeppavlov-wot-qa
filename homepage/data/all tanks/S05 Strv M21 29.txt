In the authors opinion, not recommended as the first tank to play in a player's first game after the tutorial missions. S05 Strv M21 29   The Strv fm/21 presents a long profile as you round buildings leaving it vulnerable to tracking and other module damage. S05 Strv M21 29   The turret is rear mounted, like most tier 1 tanks and the armour plate at rear of the tank is steep. S05 Strv M21 29   If you are the lead tank in urban maps, presenting the rear of the tank to the enemy may be an effective use of the tank as the reverse speed is the highest of tier 1 tanks. S05 Strv M21 29   The armour is 14mm all round on both the hull and turret. S05 Strv M21 29 

Based on the stats it may be better to use the stock tier 1 gun over the researched tier 2 gun. S05 Strv M21 29 

Crew: While this tank is crewed with a radio operator, other Swedish tanks at the lower tiers the commander operates the radio. S05 Strv M21 29

Sweden, due to its geographical location, has for a long time been able to stay out of European conflicts. S05 Strv M21 29  But in the time of World War One, it became clear that Sweden could not rely on just its position, but it also would need a modern army. S05 Strv M21 29  During this time, Sweden had close relations with Germany and in 1918, Swedish military attaché in Berlin was shown a knocked out British Mk IV tank. S05 Strv M21 29  This would plant the seed of Swedish interest in tanks and as early as one year later, in 1919, attempts were made to purchase the British Whippet light tank. S05 Strv M21 29  Due to the lack of money and enthusiasm from the army however, this led nowhere. S05 Strv M21 29  Instead, negotiations were taken up with the Germans two years later, in 1921. S05 Strv M21 29  Sweden was offered to secretly buy 10 German tanks, that had been produced, but never used because of the end of the war. S05 Strv M21 29

These tanks were the “Leichter Kampfwagen II” light tanks, meant for easy mass production. S05 Strv M21 29  The design borrowed heavily from British Whippet and French FT-17. S05 Strv M21 29  The tank was based on a car chassis from Daimler, it had front mounted engine and rear mounted superstructure, armed with a cannon. S05 Strv M21 29  Sweden was however not satisfied with the design and ordered several modifications to be made. S05 Strv M21 29  Amongst the changes were the addition of fully traversable turret, as well as changes to the frontal hull. S05 Strv M21 29  In late August 1921, the parts for the vehicles were imported from Germany as “tractors” and “boiler plates” to circumvent the Versailles treaty. S05 Strv M21 29  Assembly began as soon as the parts were available and in 1922, all the vehicles were ready. S05 Strv M21 29

This new tank was designated Pansarvagn försöksmodell/1922, but this was soon changed to Strv fm/21. S05 Strv M21 29  The new tank was the first armored vehicle in Sweden. S05 Strv M21 29  It had an unusual layout with the engine in the front and the turret in the rear, it weighed 9 tons and was armed with an 8mm machinegun, it was powered by the Benz 1910 55hp engine. S05 Strv M21 29 

After some rudimentary one month tests in 1922, the tanks were put in storage. S05 Strv M21 29  It was not until Autumn 1923 that five of the most reliable tanks would see action again. S05 Strv M21 29  They were shipped across the country to a military exercise in Skåne, where they took part in a simulated attack. S05 Strv M21 29  Here, the tanks were used in the support of Swedish infantry and because so few people knew of their existence, the exercise was a huge success. S05 Strv M21 29  During late 1923 and 1924, the tanks were disassembled for the hardening of their armour plates, which took place at the navy shipbuilding yard in Stockholm. S05 Strv M21 29

From 1924 to 1927, the tanks took part in series of tests and experiments. S05 Strv M21 29  Among these was the experimental fitting of a radio receiver on tank number 5 and radio transmitters on tanks 10 and 6. S05 Strv M21 29  In 1923, Sweden had also purchased one surplus FT-17, that had been used in the war and was in bad condition. S05 Strv M21 29  The vehicle was soon scrapped, but its 37mm gun remained and was tested on one of the Strv m/21. S05 Strv M21 29  The gun would eventually end up on an armored car in 1926. S05 Strv M21 29  During this time, there were also several interesting tests with camouflage. S05 Strv M21 29  Originally the tank had been painted in field gray, but now, 2 variants of winter camouflage were tested and during summer, the tank was covered with a three color green, brown and yellow pattern with black lines in-between, shared with the Pbil fm/26 armored car. S05 Strv M21 29  As the testing continued, the lack of spare parts started to become a problem and even though some of the replacement suspension parts were now being produced, tanks number 1, 3, 4, 8 and 9 still had to be stripped for parts. S05 Strv M21 29  It was not until 1927 the parts needed to keep all the tanks in running condition were delivered. S05 Strv M21 29

Soon it became clear that the Strv m/21 was growing increasingly obsolete and in 1928, a project was started to develop the new Swedish tank. S05 Strv M21 29  This resulted in the purchase of a Renault NC-27, which was deemed unsuitable for Swedish conditions. S05 Strv M21 29  Today, this is the only NC-27 remaining in the world and it can be seen at the Arsenalen museum. S05 Strv M21 29  Instead of purchasing the French tank, it was decided to upgrade the Strv fm/21. S05 Strv M21 29  In 1929, the schematics for a slightly improved fm/21 called Strv m/21-29 were ready. S05 Strv M21 29  Changes were made to the engine, which was replaced by a Swedish Scania-Vabis 1544 85hp engine, and the tank recieved electric lighting. S05 Strv M21 29  Two of these tanks were ordered and in 1930, they were finished. S05 Strv M21 29  During the same time, one of the Strv fm/21 was being tested with a 37mm Škoda infantry gun, but the tests were unsuccessful. S05 Strv M21 29  Between 1931 and 1934, three more Strv fm/21 were modernized to Strv m/21-29 by the Landsverk company as training vehicles, until new tanks could be delivered. S05 Strv M21 29  It was not until 1938 that the Strv m/21-29 was retired from service with the purchase of the Czech ČKD AH-IV tankette. S05 Strv M21 29

Today, three examples of the Strv m/21-29 remain – one in the Munster museum, and the final two are in the Strängnäs/Arsenalen museum, one of these is under restoration to driveable condition. S05 Strv M21 29

Its maximum speed of real life vehicle is only 16 KM/H. S05 Strv M21 29  But for making this vehicle not underpowered from its very low speed in same tier, Wargaming decided to increased this vehicle speed to 25 KM/H which is on par with most of tier 1. S05 Strv M21 29
