This SPG is a fun artillery piece. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  Its gun is somewhat low-damaged, but it fires quickly which helps to keep enemies pinned down in certain situations. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  The Loyd Gun Carriage is a low profile machine and is surprisingly maneuverable so it will not find it difficult to reach small bushes or areas of rubble with which it can hide itself. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage 
The Q. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage F. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  13-Pr. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  Mk. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  III comes with a decent 42mm of penetration will have no problem punching through the lightly armored targets you will be facing with this SPG. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  The 165 average damage is also nice. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage The reload on this SPG is not bad at 6. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage 67 rounds a minute. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  This is right in the middle for tier 2 SPG's as only the [[SU-18]] (7. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage 5 rounds) and [[RenaultBS]] (7. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage 69 rounds) fire quicker. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  Its reload beats the [[T57]] (6. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage 38 rounds) and the [[Tank:GW Mk VIe|G. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage Pz. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  Mk. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  VI(e)]] (2. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage 22 rounds). GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage 
The view range of the Loyd Gun Carriage is also superb for its tier at 320m. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  When compared to other SPG's at this tier, they fall in at 260-280m. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  The LGC is 40m better off than its peers. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage If necessary the the LGC can spot its own targets later on in a game much more effectively than its counterparts. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage

|History=

The Loyd Gun Carriage was a proposal for the British army to mount a 76. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage 2-mm gun on the chassis of the Loyd Carrier artillery truck. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  Developed from 1940 through 1941. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  The project was scrapped in the drawings phase and no prototypes were manufactured. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  However. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  there are several documented examples of vehicles being modified to carry artillery pieces, although that was more of an improvisation rather then a real project being prepared for mass production. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  

==Development history==
[[image:Loyd_Carrier_modified_to_carry_a_25_pounder_howitzer. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage jpg|thumb|200px|left|Loyd Carrier modified to carry a 25 pounder howitzer]]
The Loyd Carrier was built upon the mechanicals (engine, gearbox and transmission) of a 15 cwt 4x2 Fordson 7V truck with mild steel bodywork to which armour plate (referred to as 'BP Plate' in Loyd manuals) was bolted (to the front and upper sides) depending on application. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  The engine was at the rear of the Carrier with the radiator behind rather than in front. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  The transmission then took the drive forward to the axle at the very front where it drove the tracks. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  Both the front drive sprockets and idlers (which were also sprocketed) at the rear of the tracks were fitted with brakes, actuated by a pair of levers by the driver. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  To turn the vehicle to the left, the brakes were applied on that side and the Carrier would slew round the stopped track. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  The upper hull covered the front and sides but was open to the rear and above; as the Carrier was not expected to function as a fighting vehicle this was not an issue. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  To protect the occupants from the weather a canvas tilt could be put up; this was standard fitment from the factory. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  As part of the rapid development program and use of pre-designed parts the Loyd used parts from other vehicles. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  From the Universal Carrier the track, drive sprockets, and suspension units. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  From the Fordson 7V, the chassis, engine, gearbox, torque tube, axle and brakes. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage 

The Army tested the Loyd Carrier in 1939 and placed an initial order for 200 as the Carrier, Tracked, Personnel Carrying i. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage e. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  a personnel carrier. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  Initial deliveries were from Vivian Loyd's own company but production moved to the larger firms including the Ford Motor Company and Wolseley Motors ( 13,000 between them) and Dennis Brothers Ltd, Aveling & Barford and Sentinel Waggon Works. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  Total production of the Loyd Carrier was approximately 26,000
