GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  there are several documented examples of vehicles being modified to carry artillery pieces, although that was more of an improvisation rather then a real project being prepared for mass production.

The Loyd Carrier was built upon the mechanicals (engine, gearbox and transmission) of a 15 cwt 4x2 Fordson 7V truck with mild steel bodywork to which armour plate (referred to as 'BP Plate' in Loyd manuals) was bolted (to the front and upper sides) depending on application. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  The engine was at the rear of the Carrier with the radiator behind rather than in front. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  The transmission then took the drive forward to the axle at the very front where it drove the tracks. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  Both the front drive sprockets and idlers (which were also sprocketed) at the rear of the tracks were fitted with brakes, actuated by a pair of levers by the driver. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  To turn the vehicle to the left, the brakes were applied on that side and the Carrier would slew round the stopped track. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  The upper hull covered the front and sides but was open to the rear and above; as the Carrier was not expected to function as a fighting vehicle this was not an issue. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  To protect the occupants from the weather a canvas tilt could be put up; this was standard fitment from the factory. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  As part of the rapid development program and use of pre-designed parts the Loyd used parts from other vehicles. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  From the Universal Carrier the track, drive sprockets, and suspension units. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage  From the Fordson 7V, the chassis, engine, gearbox, torque tube, axle and brakes. GB25 Loyd Gun Carriage
