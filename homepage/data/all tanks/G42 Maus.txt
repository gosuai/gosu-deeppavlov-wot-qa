{{TankData|Tank= Maus
|The heaviest (although, thanks to the [[Type 5 Heavy]], no longer biggest) tank in World of Tanks, the Maus is certainly a mammoth tank, with the largest health pool of any other vehicle currently in the game. G42 Maus  Combining that immense hitpoint count with some of the thickest tank armor around means that if an enemy vehicles gun lacks any significant penetration capability, fighting the Maus will not go well. G42 Maus  However, the lack of sloping anywhere on the tank, except for the frontal armor, can allow tank guns with adequate penetration to punch through the sides and rear with relative ease; even more so if the Maus is not angled properly. G42 Maus  Additionally, weaknesses in the frontal armor such as the lower glacis plate are fairly large and can be reliably targeted. G42 Maus  Another weakness when engaging this tank from the front is to shoot at its turret "cheeks" because despite their sloped appearance and high armor values, the turret cheeks are mostly flat mid center and will rarely withstand a shell with sufficient penetration. G42 Maus  This can be quite difficult to achieve, however, if the driver turns the turret away to angle the armor. G42 Maus  In fact, most of the aforementioned weaknesses can be negated by simply positioning the tank in a way that makes incoming shells impact at an angle. G42 Maus 

The 12. G42 Maus 8cm main gun is similar to the 130mm cannon of the [[IS-7]], dealing the same amount of damage but sacrificing penetration for improved accuracy. G42 Maus  The low damage output of the 12. G42 Maus 8 cm gun means that the Maus is best served as a team's front line vanguard, forcing a breakthrough and drawing the bulk of enemy fire while it's teammates follow through and return fire back at the attackers. G42 Maus  The maneuverability of the Maus is what one would expect from a super heavy tank - slow and cumbersome. G42 Maus  This makes the Maus a favored target of artillery although even tier X SPGs will become frustrated when faced with dealing relatively minimal damage to the Maus as opposed to other, less armored tanks. G42 Maus  Especially so if the Maus is fitted with reinforced spall liner. G42 Maus  Overall the Maus is definitely a front line combatant and should be used as such. G42 Maus  Advancing on enemy positions while protecting it's teammates with it's impressive armor will ensure a confident assault and will significantly increase your odds of success. G42 Maus 

As of patch 9. G42 Maus 17. G42 Maus 1, the Maus received a significant buff to its performance. G42 Maus  Its turret front became even more armored, allowing for a significantly lesser amount of angling in order to maximize the armor's performance as well as the removal of the glaring track weakspots located behind the "mud flaps" in the front of the tank. G42 Maus  The gun of the Maus was not left out in the cold either. G42 Maus  It's DPM, dispersion values, accuracy and aim time were all majorly improved. G42 Maus  In it's current iteration, the Maus is a tremendous threat to any team and can overrun defenses as well as repel attacks with extraordinary efficiency. G42 Maus  

|InTheGame_pros=
- Absolutely monstrous all-around armor (best overall in the game), best tank for sidescraping. G42 Maus  

- Thickest side and rear armor in the game, even without angling its practically immune to some tier 8 mediums, Combined with extremely thick side armor and tracks it is almost impossible to damage and track Maus at same time, with expection of some very high pen APCR rounds. G42 Maus 

- Single largest HP pool in the game at 3000. G42 Maus 

- Heaviest tank in the game, makes even small collisions with enemy tanks do decent damage and in turn minimizes incoming ramming damage. G42 Maus 

- Good rate of fire for its alpha, with a DPM of just under 3000 with equipment and BiA. G42 Maus 

- Extremely low dispersion loss when turning turret and generally good accuracy on move. G42 Maus 

- Engine has the highest horsepower in the game(1750), can push the wrecks of any tank with ease(except another Maus or Mauschen)

|InTheGame_cons=
- Somewhat low penetration for its tier, though insane gun handling, accuracy and APCR rounds typically makes up for it

- Huge shilouette and terrible camo values; priority target for SPGs. G42 Maus 

- Very poor overall mobility, Extremely sluggish on hill. G42 Maus 

- Lower plate needs to be angled or becomes a weakspot; unangled turret face can be reliably penned by 300+ pen premium ammo

|InTheGame_performance=
When you think about the Maus, the first thing that comes to mind is armor. G42 Maus  It is true that the Maus has impenetrable armor - if it doesn't show its weak face, that is. G42 Maus  The worst thing about this tank is the frontal turret armor, particularly on the cheeks. G42 Maus  Even the lower plate of this tank is not a real problem when angled, because it is a really small weakspot, especially from a distance. G42 Maus  But you won't need to worry about this part of the tank because you'll only be sidescraping. G42 Maus  In sidescraping, you can only be penetrated in two parts: frontal turret armor, and the sides if overangled, especially by HEATs. G42 Maus  The world would be completely different for this tank if there wasn't gold ammunition in this game, but this is not true; once enemies load the gold, it is game over for the Maus. G42 Maus  It cannot even trade effectively because turret rotation is slow, and that means that enemies will shoot you first on your face, and then retreat before you can retaliate. G42 Maus  So what can the mighty Maus do after all?

Well, first look at the match-ups. G42 Maus  When you are top tier, you can grab some popcorn and just kill everyone. G42 Maus  Tier VIII tanks are pathetically weak against your armor, some even when they load gold. G42 Maus  You have to take full advantage of these situations and be a bit aggressive, especially if the majority of the enemy heavies are low tier. G42 Maus  You have an incredible amount of HP, so you don't really need to worry about taking a shot or two. G42 Maus  Also, when equipped with a spall liner, this tank is surprisingly strong against artillery (trust me, you'll be eating a lot of those with your size). G42 Maus  Artillery will deal from 100 to 500 damage if you are unlucky, but you can even absorb some shells, especially from the weaker arty like the french tier X. G42 Maus  Additionally, the penetration of this gun in lower tier matches is not a problem at all. G42 Maus  But remember to get cocky only when the situation allows you to: if you get too far ahead, you'll get flanked by the enemy mediums and regret your life choices. G42 Maus 

So things look kind of pretty in low tier matches. G42 Maus  What do you do though when you are matched against tier X? Well, this is where things get complicated. G42 Maus . G42 Maus . G42 Maus 

Here armor won't help you at all. G42 Maus  At first you will feel brave and go in the frontlines, hoping to sidescrape and bounce everything. G42 Maus  Everything seems to go well, when suddenly, while you rotate your turret trying to aim a shot, the enemies load gold, you get penetrated in front of your turret, and your shot bounces as the enemy heads for cover. G42 Maus  What is this situation? This is the normal situation, if the Maus decides to go in the front. G42 Maus  Unlike the russian heavies that have literally impenetrable turrets, this tank cannot compete against them. G42 Maus  With these facts,  the Maus is practically kicked away from the frontline. G42 Maus  In the old days this was not the case, but this is the new sad reality for the Maus. G42 Maus  With improvisation, however, anything can happen. G42 Maus 

You see, the gun of this tank is amazing. G42 Maus  It handles incredibly well, aim time is excellent (almost the same as S. G42 Maus  Conqueror), it is pretty accurate and allows for some great snapshots - you don't even need Vertical Stabilizer for this to happen. G42 Maus  Alpha is good, even DPM is okay. G42 Maus  The only bad thing is the penetration, but when you load the APCR, this gun turns into magic. G42 Maus  So what options does this allow? One option is sniping. G42 Maus 
No, you shouldn't hide in the bushes like a TD, because it is like hiding an elephant in a room. G42 Maus  What you should do is just fight from a distance. G42 Maus  In large maps you can sit behind a big rock or wall and snipe enemies effectively. G42 Maus  From a distance you won't be so easy to penetrate, especially by low velocity and low accuracy guns, while your accurate gun and high velocity APCR (if you load them) will be extremely effective from a distance. G42 Maus  However when playing from a distance, that means you are not in a city most of the times. G42 Maus  That means that you will become even more of a juicy target for the artillery. G42 Maus  So always look at the match-up and plan carefully. G42 Maus  If there is 3 artilleries and it is a tier X game, it is the worst situation for the Maus, but with good cover you can manage. G42 Maus  Map knowledge is very helpful for the Maus. G42 Maus 

After all this it should also be noted that going along with heavies is not a completely lost situation. G42 Maus  In small maps like Himmelsdorf, you don't have much of an option anyway. G42 Maus  You just need to be very patient; wait until enemies are occupied with your allies, make your shot and quicky hide your turret. G42 Maus  Remember that with your cheeks covered, you still are impenetrable. G42 Maus  Even HE will mostly be absorbed (except large caliber), especially when you equip the Spall Liner. G42 Maus  

As a final note, it is a good idea to experiment with the new equipment with this tank. G42 Maus  For example, Improved hardening will give you the highest HP bonus out of any other tank, that is 300 extra hitpoints when equipped to the special slot. G42 Maus  Improved Rotation Mechanism might alleviate (but not completely cure) the problem of the slow turret rotation. G42 Maus  Trades might become a bit easier from close range, while snapshots will become even more effective. G42 Maus  Finally, never forget the Spall Liner. G42 Maus  The Maus gets the Superheavy Spall Liner which is the strongest, and since you have an enormous size, it is highly recommended you equip it, even in the special slot. G42 Maus

[[image:Maus tank. G42 Maus jpg|thumb|200px|left|Maus Super Heavy Tank]]
''Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus'' was a German World War II super-heavy tank completed in late 1944. G42 Maus  It is the heaviest fully-enclosed armored fighting vehicle ever built. G42 Maus  Only one complete prototype was built before the testing grounds were captured by the advancing Soviet forces. G42 Maus  That single complete prototype unit underwent trials in late 1944. G42 Maus  It was 10. G42 Maus 2 meters long, 3. G42 Maus 71 meters  wide, and 3. G42 Maus 63 meters tall. G42 Maus  Weighing 200 metric tons, the Maus' primary weapon was a 128 mm KwK 44 gun (55 calibers long barrel), based on the 12. G42 Maus 8 cm Pak 44 anti-tank artillery piece, with a coaxial 75 mm gun. G42 Maus  The 128 mm gun was powerful enough to destroy any enemy armored fighting vehicle at close or mid-range, and even some at ranges in excess of 3500 meters. G42 Maus  The principal problem in development of the Maus was finding an engine powerful enough for its weight that could fit the tank. G42 Maus  Though the design called for a maximal speed of 20 kilometers per hour, no available engine was able to accelerate the prototype to more than 13 kilometers per hour, even in perfect conditions. G42 Maus  The weight of the tank also made it unable to cross most bridges, although it still could ford, or submerge and use a snorkel to get across a river. G42 Maus 

== Development history ==
[[image:Maus Demonstration model for remote control and a wooden model probably 1 1 M Adolf Hitler and his suite of 05 14 1943. G42 Maus jpg|thumb|200px|right|Remotely controlled demo model presented to Adolf Hitler and his staff in 1943. G42 Maus ]]
The basic design known as the VK 100. G42 Maus 01/Porsche Type 205 was presented to Adolf Hitler by Ferdinand Porsche in June 1942 and was subsequently approved. G42 Maus  The design up to then had been the culmination of work done by Porsche, who had won the contract for the heavy tank that March. G42 Maus  Work on the design began in earnest; the first prototype, to be ready in 1943, was initially christened ''Mammut'' (Mammoth). G42 Maus  This was reportedly changed to ''Mäuschen'' (Little Mouse) in December 1942, and finally, to ''Maus'' (Mouse) in February 1943, which became the most common name for this tank. G42 Maus  Its ordnance inventory designation was ''SdKfz 205''. G42 Maus 

From the very beginning Maus was designed to use the "electric transmission" design which Ferdinand Porsche had used in his unsuccessful attempt to win the production contract for the Tiger. G42 Maus  The initial prototypes used a gasoline engine (the later ones were to use a diesel engine) that powered a massive electrical generator; together, they occupied the entire central rear two-thirds of the Maus' hull, thus disallowing direct access from forward driver's compartment in the hull to the turret. G42 Maus  Each meter-wide track, which used the same basic "contact shoe" and "connector link" design format as the Henschel-built King Tiger, had its own electric motor mounted in the rear of the hull; the tracks had no mechanical connection to the internal combustion engine that powered the Maus. G42 Maus  Due to the uniquely wide tracks used (1100 mm each), there was a narrow lengthwise "tunnel" inside the hull under and to the rear of the turret to house the engine and generator of the tank's power-train. G42 Maus 

The amount of armor was substantial: the hull front was 220 mm thick; the sides and rear of the hull up to 190 mm. G42 Maus  The turret armor was even thicker: up to 240 mm in the front and 220 mm on the sides and rear. G42 Maus  The mantlet was 250 mm thick;  combined with the turret armor behind it, the protection of that area was even greater. G42 Maus 

The initial plan for the Maus called for the completion of the prototype by the summer of 1943, with monthly production scheduled to run at five vehicles per month once the prototype has been delivered. G42 Maus  The work on the Maus would be divided between Krupp, responsible for the chassis, armament and turret, and Alkett, who would perform the final assembly. G42 Maus 

The Maus tank was originally designed to weigh approximately 100 tons and be armed with a 128 mm main gun and a 75 mm co-axial secondary gun. G42 Maus  Additional armament options were researched into, including various versions of 150 mm and 128 mm guns. G42 Maus  In January 1943, Hitler himself insisted that the armament should consist of a 128 mm main gun with a coaxial 75 mm gun. G42 Maus 

By May 1943, a wooden mockup of the final Maus configuration was completed and presented to Hitler, who approved it for mass production, ordering a first batch of 150. G42 Maus  At this point, the estimated weight of the Maus reached 188 tons. G42 Maus  However, an anecdote suggests that Hitler claimed that the 128-mm gun looked like a ´toy gun´ in comparison with the tank, demanding it to be replaced by a 150-mm gun. G42 Maus  [[image:Maus Hull trials with concrete turret. G42 Maus jpg|thumb|200px|left|Early Maus prototype with dummy concrete turret]]

In his book ''Panzer Leader'', Heinz Guderian writes: "On May 1, a wooden model of the ''Maus'', a tank project of Porsche and Krupp, was shown to Hitler. G42 Maus  It was intended to be equipped with a 150 mm gun. G42 Maus  The total weight of the tank was supposed to reach 175 tons. G42 Maus  It should be considered that after the design changes according to Hitler's instructions, the tank's weight would approach 200 tons. G42 Maus  The model didn't have a single machine gun for close combat, and for this reason I had to reject it. G42 Maus  It had the same design flaw that made the Ferdinand unsuitable for close combat. G42 Maus  In the end, the tank will inevitably have to wage close-combat since it operates in cooperation with the infantry. G42 Maus  An intense debate started, and except for me, all of the present found the "Maus" magnificent. G42 Maus  It was promising to be exactly that, a "giant"". G42 Maus 

Development work on the Maus continued, but in October 1943, Hitler cancelled the order, which was followed in November by the order to cease development of the Maus altogether, but to continue the construction of the prototypes. G42 Maus 

== Prototypes ==
'''V1'''
[[image:Maus Early Maus prototype on trials . G42 Maus jpg|thumb|200px|left|Maus V1 protoype]]
The first, turret-less prototype (V1) was assembled by Alkett in December 1943. G42 Maus  Tests began the same month, complete with a dummy turret of the same weight as the real one. G42 Maus  The principal problem with the Maus that were discovered in this test was its power-to-weight ratio. G42 Maus  No existing engine was powerful enough to drive it at speeds anywhere near the 20 km/h demanded by the design specifications. G42 Maus  The modified gasoline-fueled Daimler-Benz MB 509 engine used in the prototype was only able to propel it at 13 km/h, and only under perfect conditions. G42 Maus  The suspension used by the Maus also had to be adjusted to enable it to bear the tank's weight. G42 Maus  Another issue found was that the Maus was simply too heavy to cross bridges. G42 Maus  As a result, an alternative system was developed, where the Maus would instead ford the rivers it needed to cross. G42 Maus  Due to its size, it could ford relatively deep streams, but for yet deeper ones it had to submerge and drive on the bottom of the river. G42 Maus  The solution required tanks to be paired up: a stationary Maus would supply electrical power to the crossing vehicle over a cable until it reached the other side. G42 Maus  The crew would receive air through a large snorkel, long enough for the tank to submerge up to 13 meters. G42 Maus 

'''V2'''
[[image:Maus_assebmly. G42 Maus jpg|thumb|200px|right|Second prototype assembly]]
In March 1944, the second prototype, the V2, was delivered. G42 Maus  It differed in many details from the V1 prototype. G42 Maus  In mid-1944, the V2 prototype was fitted with a powerplant and the first manufactured Maus turret. G42 Maus  This turret was fitted with a 128 mm KwK 44 L/55 gun, with coaxial 75 mm KwK 44 L/36. G42 Maus 5 gun and a 7. G42 Maus 92 mm MG34 for anti-aircraft armament. G42 Maus  The V1 prototype was supposed to be fitted with the second manufactured turret, but this never happened. G42 Maus  By July 1944, Krupp was in the process of manufacturing four more Maus hulls, but they were ordered to halt production and scrap these. G42 Maus  Krupp ceased all work on it in August 1944. G42 Maus  Meanwhile, the V2 prototype entered tests in September 1944, fitted with a Daimler-Benz MB 517 diesel engine, new electric steering system, and a Skoda Works-designed running gear and tracks. G42 Maus  A special railroad car was made to transport the Maus prototypes. G42 Maus  An anti-aircraft version of the Maus - the Flakzwilling 8. G42 Maus 8 cm Auf Maus with two 88-mm guns in a special turret was being designed, but the project never left the blueprint stage. G42 Maus 

== Fate ==
[[image:Maus Rescue veichle towing a destroyed Maus prototype. G42 Maus jpg|thumb|200px|left|It took six 18t half-tracks to salvage the turret from the destroyed V2 prototype]]
The operational Maus prototypes remained at Kummersdorf and at the proving grounds in Böblingen. G42 Maus  In the last weeks of the war, the V1 with the dummy turret was captured by the advancing Soviet forces in the vicinity of the western batteries of the Kummersdorf artillery firing grounds. G42 Maus  It had been thought to be mechanically sabotaged by the Germans before abandoning it. G42 Maus  Some sources state that the ''Panzerkampfwagen VIII'' saw combat while defending the facility at Kummersdorf, although the popular version is that it did not. G42 Maus  The Soviet Commander of Armored and Mechanized troops ordered the hull of V1 to be mated with the turret of V2. G42 Maus  The Soviets used six 18t German half-tracks to pull the 55-ton turret off the burned-out hull. G42 Maus  The combined V1 hull/V2 turret vehicle was completed in Germany and sent back to the USSR for further testing. G42 Maus  It arrived there on May 4, 1946. G42 Maus  When further testing was completed, the vehicle was taken over by the Kubinka Tank Museum for storage where it is now on display. G42 Maus  It appears that the capture of this prototype had little impact on post-war Soviet tank development. G42 Maus  Soviet tank design continued to concentrate on maneuverability by strictly limiting size and weight. G42 Maus  The next-generation Soviet tanks had similar levels of protection and armament: the IS-3 heavy tank was armed with a 122 mm gun, but weighed under 50 tons; the T-54 main battle tank, which entered production in 1947, provided 200 mm of frontal turret armor, 100 mm of frontal hull armor and a 100 mm main gun, while weighing in at slightly less than 40 tons.
