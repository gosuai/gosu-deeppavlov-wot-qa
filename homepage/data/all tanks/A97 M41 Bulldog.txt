|InTheGame_performance=
The high-powered 76mm guns originally included the T91E5 10-shot automatic loader, one of the best automatic loading guns on any Tier 7 light tank and all light tanks in general. A97 M41 Bulldog 
Unfortunately, with patch 9. A97 M41 Bulldog 18 this has been reduced to six shots, while keeping the same reload time and it was subsequently removed altogether. A97 M41 Bulldog 

You might want to mount "Wet Ammo Rack" equipment or take on "Safe Stowage" skill on your loader to reduce the risk of an ammorack detonation; the ammunition rack is rather fragile. A97 M41 Bulldog  You should never point the front of your tank to any mediums or heavies you meet, as getting hit dead-center as stated in the cons will damage your ammo rack. A97 M41 Bulldog 

Keep your side to the enemy as your tracks can sometimes protect you from any damage at all. A97 M41 Bulldog  This tactic is assisted with "Enhanced Suspension". A97 M41 Bulldog  However, rely on this tactic as a last-resort; you are a fragile tank whose armor can easily be perforated by low-tier automatic cannons. A97 M41 Bulldog 

The best overall strategy is to avoid getting shot at; fragile modules, easily wounded crew members, thin armor and low hitpoints compared to other vehicles are incentives to avoid getting shot at. A97 M41 Bulldog 

Use your 400m view range, 30+ hp/ton power-weight ration and 68kph top speed to reach aggressive spotting positions, detecting the enemy as they come. A97 M41 Bulldog  Once spotted, retreat and spot elsewhere. A97 M41 Bulldog  As the game wears on and filled with wounded tanks and gaps appear in the battle lines, exploit these in a typical light tank fashion, savaging isolated and wounded tanks and hapless artillery. A97 M41 Bulldog  If necessary, use this to capture a base; if there is no light or fast medium tanks, they will react rather slowly. A97 M41 Bulldog  

Passive-aggressive tactics are the best for this vehicle in the initial stages of the battle; use your speed to get to aggressive forward positions but remain concealed, spotting enemy vehicles. A97 M41 Bulldog  If they are distracted by larger opponents, use your excellent 76mm gun to land distracting shots into vulnerable side and rear armor. A97 M41 Bulldog  This distraction could allow stronger tanks on your team to overwhelm them while they attempt to engage the new threat you have became. A97 M41 Bulldog 

If you encounter opposing lights, assess the situation. A97 M41 Bulldog  If you are outnumbered, outgunned, or have little, if any, support, retreat! Use the speed and maneuverability that got you there to get out of there. A97 M41 Bulldog  If the opponent is outnumbered, outgunned or you have superior support, engage them in a tank melee. A97 M41 Bulldog  

After the initial slugging match, engage gaps in the enemy line to savage the weak, isolated or unaware; lone heavy tanks which survived the slug fest, camping tank destroyers and artillery are prime targets. A97 M41 Bulldog 

If it is tactically suitable to cap, such as to bait opponents or to win a game, then do so. A97 M41 Bulldog  If it is not possible to engage opponents from the front, then the sides and rear are good areas to shoot; while there are many tanks with impenetrable front turret or hull armor, there are very few tanks with enough side or rear armor to bounce your shots without severe angling. A97 M41 Bulldog  Avoid at-tier or higher-tier medium tanks in all scenarios if possible, especially those of the Soviet, Chinese and American variety. A97 M41 Bulldog 

While they may not have your mobility, they have enough to render yours less relevant. A97 M41 Bulldog  They are also most likely better armed, more durable and better armored than you. A97 M41 Bulldog  Engage them only with proper support or in an ambush. A97 M41 Bulldog  

Overall, and quite sadly, the Patch 9. A97 M41 Bulldog 18 reshuffle of light tanks has reduced the Walker-Bulldog from being one of the best light tanks in the game to being severely underpowered. A97 M41 Bulldog  Having moved from tier 7 to tier 8, the Walker-Bulldog effectively gets the same matchmaking as before, but the removal of its autoloader has been one of the most crippling factors this vehicle has suffered, making it by far the worst tank in the U. A97 M41 Bulldog S. A97 M41 Bulldog  scout line. A97 M41 Bulldog  

It sees Clan War use, along with its premium equivalent, the German [[leKpz M41 F 90mm GF]], which is vastly superior to it when it comes to firepower, owing it to its larger caliber gun and also by being 4km/h faster. A97 M41 Bulldog 

|InTheGame_research=
If you have played equal American tanks before you might have radio and engine already unlocked. A97 M41 Bulldog  If not, the stock engine is good, so engine can be researched last. A97 M41 Bulldog  Before unlocking the second gun you will be under-gunned. A97 M41 Bulldog  So tracks should be your main unlock goal. A97 M41 Bulldog  The second gun first (for more alpha damage), then tracks. A97 M41 Bulldog  After that unlock the rest in your preferred order. A97 M41 Bulldog 
It is possible to research everything with the stock tracks. A97 M41 Bulldog  Focus on the armament and turret for the 76mm Gun M32, as it does not add any weight on the vehicle and adds 25mm of penetration and the use of APCR and HEAT in exchange for a loss of rate of fire. A97 M41 Bulldog  The top turret can be mounted with the stock suspension, and adds 20 meters of view range. A97 M41 Bulldog  Then the radio should be researched, as the stock engine is very good and only adds 50hp, where the upgraded radio adds 335 meters of extra radio range. A97 M41 Bulldog  Once the radio is upgraded, the engine can be upgraded, as it weighs the same as the stock engine. A97 M41 Bulldog  The tracks, while not necessary unless mounting the top gun, improve maneuverability and ground resistance and is worthy to research. A97 M41 Bulldog  As it stands, the top gun is a joke. A97 M41 Bulldog  16. A97 M41 Bulldog 400 xp for a bit better dispersion and a slightly higher dpm. A97 M41 Bulldog  Save your xp for the tier 9 instead. A97 M41 Bulldog

|History=

The M41 Walker Bulldog was a U. A97 M41 Bulldog S. A97 M41 Bulldog  light tank developed to replace the M24 Chaffee. A97 M41 Bulldog  It was named for General Walton Walker who died in a jeep accident in Korea. A97 M41 Bulldog  On 7 November 1950, the US Ordnance Committee Minutes (OCM) issued item #33476, redesignating the heavy, medium, and light tank, according to the armament; the 120mm (heavy) Gun Tanks, 90mm (medium) Gun Tanks, and the 76mm (light) Gun tanks. A97 M41 Bulldog 


==Development and production history==
While the M24 Chaffee was a successful design, its main gun was not effective enough against well armored opponents. A97 M41 Bulldog  Although the primary mission of a light tank was scouting, the U. A97 M41 Bulldog S. A97 M41 Bulldog  Army wanted one with more powerful armament. A97 M41 Bulldog  The development of the new tank, T37, began in 1947. A97 M41 Bulldog  The vehicle was designed to be air-transportable, and the desired anti-tank capabilities were provided by installing a long 76 mm gun with an advanced rangefinder. A97 M41 Bulldog  In 1949, with the adoption of a less ambitious rangefinder, the project's designation was changed to T41. A97 M41 Bulldog  Production started in 1951 at Cadillac's Cleveland Tank Plant, and by 1953 the new tank completely replaced the M24 in the United States Army. A97 M41 Bulldog  Initially it was nicknamed "Little Bulldog", then renamed "Walker Bulldog" after General Walton Walker, who was killed in a jeep accident in Korea in 1950. A97 M41 Bulldog 

The M41 was an agile and well armed vehicle. A97 M41 Bulldog  On the other hand, it was noisy, fuel-hungry and heavy enough to cause problems with air transport.
