|The Ikv 65 still retains the "Glass cannon" traits from its predecessor ; It has quite great mobility and has small size that provides great camouflage rating, but also doesn't have armor protection. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  This TD abandons the traits from the early Ikv project that classed it as an Infantry support SPG in real life, with powerful derp shot, but with awful gun handling. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  Instead, Ikv 65 offers much better gun handling and excellent penetration, in exchange for much lower alpha damage. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  That makes it the true sniper in its tier.

|InTheGame_pros= 

- Very high top speed and acceleration due to low weight

- Satisfactory penetration and damage, especially at top tier

- Excellent turning. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  Can spin quickly directly after moving

- Maintains its trait of plentiful gun depression

- Exceptional camouflage ratings

- Reverse speed allows the tank to hide as soon as it is spotted

- Very playable stock, with good mobility and a gun that has decent penetration

|InTheGame_cons= 

- By far the lowest DPM of any Tier 6 tank destroyer, Jagdpanzer IV has almost 1k more (70%!)

- Absolutely no armor, most gun's HE shells can rip it to pieces; easily oneshotted by howitzers and can be a prized target to SPGs

- Reasonably tight gun arc

- Gun's accuracy demands some aim time

- Long reload for a gun with this damage

- Mediocre momentum; often swings when braking at high speed, combined with tight gun arc makes it unsuitable for snapshots

- Tends to getting flipped a lot when running over some small rocks due to instability issues

- Engine gets hit a lot

- Limited gun elevation when on a downward slope

This tank is a great sniper, and was built to be. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  Take advantage of your good gun depression and high pen to snipe away at tanks from far away. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  If things get too hairy, you can relocate and run away. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  With your top speed, you can also act as a ninja TD in some cases, and sometimes be able to flank enemy tank destroyers! Some reliable tactics are to use the excellent reverse speed of 20kmh and your reasonably small profile to kite enemies around terrain such as rocks and undulations to make up for your terrible DPM. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  Use this to out trade opponents with higher DPM than you and remain reasonably healthy for late game. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  Another technique is to train camo crew and abuse concealment like that of a light tank. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  The mobility allows it to comfortably go up to a bush, proc. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  binoculars, pull back and shoot your enemy. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2

|History= 

After the Ikv 103, it would be until the mid-60s before the Ikv concept was brought up again, but this time with an emphasis on being able to fight tanks and other AFV’s. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  In total three different companies were asked to submit their designs for the new Ikv, which they called Ikv 65. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  First there was Landsverk, who had produced the other Ikv’s. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  Then there was Hägglunds, who had just started producing their armoured personell carrier design for the Swedish army and finally there was Bofors, who was also developing the S-tank. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  Of all these companies, Landsverk was the most experienced, having produced virtually every Swedish tank design from the 1930s to the 1950s. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  Landsverk had however fallen on hard times lately after losing the contract for the army’s new APC to Hägglunds, but it was decided to make a last ditch effort to keep the military part of the company going and five different designs were submitted for the new Ikv project. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  The first proposal was essentially a rebuilt Ikv 103 with a bigger superstructure and bigger engine. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  The main armament, shared between all the proposals, was a Bofors 90mm L/54 low pressure gun, developed from the Pvpj1110 recoilless rifle. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  There was however a number of versions of this gun considered (although not directly by Landsverk). S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2

The other Ikv 65 proposals used their own original suspension and did not vary that much from each other, except for the final design, which was to be based of the Pbv 302 APC chassis and was to have a fully traversable turret

Despite the Landsverk design being the one preferred by the Army, it was ultimately decided to go with the Hägglunds design due to the greater interchangeability of parts between the new Ikv and the Hägglunds-designed and built Pbv 302 APC. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  Eventually, this led to the production Ikv 91 in 1975, but that is a story for another part. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  After losing the contract for the Ikv 91, Landsverk did shut down its military design section and focused on the production of civilian excavators. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  After that, it wasn’t long until the remaining part of the company was sold off to Volvo BM and by the mid-70s, Landsverk was shut down for good. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2

This was Landsverk’s most detailed one and the one they favored. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2  A very detailed scale model was built, but since a competitor’s design was chosen instead, the design otherwise remained on paper. S08 Ikv 65 Alt 2
