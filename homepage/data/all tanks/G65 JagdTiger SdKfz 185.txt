{{TankData|Tank=8,8 cm Pak 43 Jagdtiger
|This Tank Destroyer is a formidable opponent on the battlefield as its main gun has excellent accuracy and an extremely high rate of fire for this tier (5. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185 5 second reload). G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  At long range situations, with the vulnerable glacis plate hidden and the robust superstructure exposed, this Tank Destroyer can become a nightmare for equal tiers to penetrate. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Its Tier IX Cousin the [[Tank:G44 JagdTiger|Jagdtiger]] has better mobility and firepower but this tank has a formidable rate of fire. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Unfortunately you share the Jagdtiger's weaknesses too which is the vulnerable glacis plate and very weak side and rear armour. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Keep at long range, avoid close combat, aim for the weakspots and you can be the deciding factor in the game. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185

Having a very armoured superstructure, an accurate gun with high rate of fire (RoF) and decent manoeuvrability, the Jagdtiger 88 is a deadly tank that can easily burn down many of the tanks with extreme damage per minute (DPM). G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Most shots from tanks you face will harmlessly bounce off your upper front plate and superstructure, but your sides are very weak and your turning ability is limited. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  With all these in mind, tactics with this tank should change over the course of the match. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185 

When the match begins, you should use your accurate gun to snipe the enemy, helping your flank thin out the enemies. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Considering that most tanks of this tier have low rates of fire, your high ROF may provide the additional firepower necessary for your allied tanks to overwhelm the opposition. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Be careful of areas with multiple shooting angles - your front may face an enemy, but your sides may face another flank! Alternatively one can engage in a frontal shoot-out, but take into account the terrain for locations where you can hide your (lower) hull and where the enemy has little to no chance of flanking you. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  The Jagdtiger 88 is unable to react to sudden changes on the battlefield due to lack of a turret, underwhelming HP/t ratio and slow hull-traverse speed. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185 

If your team is gaining the upper hand and the enemies' numbers are thinning out, you can start pushing your flank with support. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Based on previous observations of enemy positions, angle your tank to ensure that all potential fire will hit your front or bounce off your sides. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Attack enemy tanks to draw shots, which will expose them to your allies, allowing you and your team to swiftly dispose of them. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185 

If your flank is collapsing, pull back and use your high ROF to hold enemies off. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Be sure to hide your lower front plate as it is very weak. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Hopefully, more tanks will come to reinforce your flank, and your opponents will be weak enough to be easy pickings for your team. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  If such a flank is a short drive away, do not be afraid to go back and hold it - such occasions are where this tank shines, and a good defence can net 3000+ damage, several destroyed enemy top-dogs and a secured flank. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185 

Weakspot shooting is mandatory in this tank, as 212mm may not cut it on tier IX and some tier VIII opponents. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Drivers of this tanks should get familiar with where to shoot on most opponents for damage. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  The accuracy and rate of fire will handle the rest. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Reliably detracking enemies is also essential, as the gun fires faster than the speed at which a 100% crew with 100% repair can repair the track for most tanks. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Not only can this save you from flankers, but it can also earn you "damage on detrack" bonuses on tanks that you cannot reliably penetrate from your side. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185 

At all times, be wary of other TDs. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Most other Tier 8 and above TDs can either cut through your superstructure without much effort or de-track and nail you down helplessly, especially if you don't have cover. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Your large size and slow speed make you an arty magnet, and with the potential for top tier SPGs in 8. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185 6, this is an even worse issue. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  In addition, the lower glacis is very weak and should be hidden - hull-down tactics or a large rock may suffice to protect it. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Tier 9 tanks, along with a few premium-spammers, can also easily crack your upper front plate and even your superstructure. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  If you find yourself in a battle tier 9 match, switch to a purely supportive role. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185 

All in all, this tank has one of the best credit earning potentials of the tier 8 premiums. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Use your gun to chip away at enemies, and you will earn a lot from driving this tank. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185         

With its HD transformation in 9. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185 12 both Jagdtiger versions received improvements to their armour. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Most importantly frontally the MG weakspot was removed, the angle of the lower plate was improved and a small strip of 150mm of armour also exceeds to the upper part of the lower front plate. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  The Jagdtiger 88 can tank more efficiently with its frontal plates due to two reasons:

# It is one tier lower + SMM, so you will face opponents with less penetration on a regular basis
# The lower plate has a nominal armor value of 120mm instead of 100mm on the regular Jagdtiger

As a point of reference, you can safely bounce up up to 175mm of penetration plus most penetration high-rolls even if your lower plate is visible. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  When you know that the opponent you are facing uses a weapon with such weak penetration you can deliberately expose yourself to the fullest and make a move on them assuming the conditions are right (no risk of shots being fired into your side, arty, etc). G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  Of course there is always the option of the enemy using premium ammunition so it will remain a gamble. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  However if your opponent has AP loaded, he has no other choice but to use it or reload to premium ammunition. G65 JagdTiger SdKfz 185  You can use that gap to facehug the enemy (especially when he is using a high calibre weapon with long reload such as 122mm D-25T on the IS) and deny him further shots into your lower plate.
