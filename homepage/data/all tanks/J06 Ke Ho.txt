|InTheGame_pros=
*Small size and good agility
*Great firepower for a tier 4 light
*Premium AP round receives full 5 degrees of normalization and less loss of penetration over distance
*Good gun depression

|InTheGame_cons=
*Absolutely no armor
*Mediocre gun handling
*Inaccurate gun makes sniping and hitting weak spots difficult
*Relatively slow acceleration for a light tank

|InTheGame_performance=The Ke-Ho behaves much like the British Tier 4 Covenanter Light tank, yet out performs it in most ways. J06 Ke Ho   It is small in size, rather quick, with good agility, and good camo values, and a fast firing cannon makes it a mean opponent to assassinate lone enemies with. J06 Ke Ho  It also doubles as a support tank very capable of picking off enemies from around 100 meters. J06 Ke Ho  Or you can work in a light wolf pack punching holes in tanks in a not so dissimilar way to the Matilda. J06 Ke Ho  Its small size can also make it suitable for ambush duties should the situation arise. J06 Ke Ho 

The tank can take a hit but avoid brawling with anything other than lower tiers or badly wounded tanks as the armor is so thin a swift breeze could go through it, do however take advantage of the tiny turret and excellent gun depression to fire shots from behind cover. J06 Ke Ho 

This tank has one of the meanest guns at tier 4, the 57mm experimental is capable of more than 1,875 DPM, its aim time is a little slow but you need not wait to fire if you are close enough to your target. J06 Ke Ho  The penetration can get through targets easily up to Tier 5, and the damage is about average for its tier. J06 Ke Ho 

The Ke-Ho Might be a difficult drive to begin with, learning not to engage with enemies until its guaranteed you're not gonna get hit maybe frustrating at first, but it's the right way to drive this tank, and most other tanks in the Japanese tree, once you've overcome this tank's weakness, you'll quickly become one of the deadliest tanks at tier 4.

|History=

The Type 5 Ke-Ho (五式軽戦車 ケホ Go-Shiki Keisensha Keho) was the last light tank designed by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA). J06 Ke Ho  Though it had performed well in the early stages of WWII and even before it, the Type 95 Ha-Go was showing it’s age by 1942. J06 Ke Ho  An attempt had already been made to replace it with the Type 98 Ke-Ni and Type 2 Ke-To. J06 Ke Ho  However, these projects failed to fully materialise . J06 Ke Ho 

Following this, the IJA decided to try again and work started on the Ke-Ho. J06 Ke Ho 

==Design and Development==

Development of this new light tank began in 1942. J06 Ke Ho  Up till then, the Ha-Go had performed well against American M3 Light tanks, but suffered dreadfully against the larger M4 Sherman. J06 Ke Ho  Its last successful engagement was against US forces on the Bataan Peninsula in December 1941 who only had M3 Stuart Light tanks. J06 Ke Ho 

Of course, the name “Tank” should be applied loosely to any Japanese armored vehicle of World War II. J06 Ke Ho  One of the major shortcomings of the Ha-Go was the fact that a . J06 Ke Ho 50 cal (12. J06 Ke Ho 7 mm) machine gun could effectively knock one out. J06 Ke Ho  The Type 98 Ke-Ni and Type 2 Ke-To had somewhat of an armor upgrade, at least enough to defend against . J06 Ke Ho 50 cal rounds. J06 Ke Ho  They still lacked a gun capable of even scratching a Sherman. J06 Ke Ho  These vehicles were not produced in substantial numbers, with only 104 Ke-Ni and 34 Ke-Tos built by the end of the war. J06 Ke Ho 

The Ke-To experimented with a slightly better main armament in the form of Type 1 37 mm (1. J06 Ke Ho 46 in) gun. J06 Ke Ho  This offered a much-needed improvement over the Type 94 37 mm (1. J06 Ke Ho 46 in) used on the Ha-Go. J06 Ke Ho  Though a step in the right direction, this weapon still was not enough to combat the M4 at any angle. J06 Ke Ho 

As such, the Ke-Ho was to be armed with the Type 1 47 mm (1. J06 Ke Ho 85 in) Tank Gun II. J06 Ke Ho  This was a planned variant of the Type 1 47 mm found on the Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank. J06 Ke Ho  The performance of the Type 1 Gun II is unknown, however the performance of the standard 47 mm is. J06 Ke Ho  Penetration of the weapon's Type 1 APHE shell at 30 degrees was 55 mm at 100 m, 40 mm at 500 m and 30 mm at 1,000 m. J06 Ke Ho  This was still only enough to penetrate the side of a Sherman, leading to the ambush style of combat used by Chi-Ha crews. J06 Ke Ho  An experimental long-barreled 57mm gun was also tested on the Ke-Ho. J06 Ke Ho 

The cannon was mounted in a turret based on the Type 1 Chi-He’s. J06 Ke Ho  It had a raised commander’s cupola, next to which was a mounting point for a Type 97 machine gun. J06 Ke Ho  This turret was mounted on an enlarged Ke-Ni/Ke-To chassis, slightly of to the right of the center line. J06 Ke Ho  It had a Type 97 MG mounted in the front right left of the bow. J06 Ke Ho  The vehicle had a short wheel base, with a bell crank suspension using a similar layout out to the Chi-He’s. J06 Ke Ho  The Ke-Ho was powered by a 150hp air-cooled diesel engine that would crank out a decent top speed of 50 km/h. J06 Ke Ho 

==Variants==

Ku-Se SPG

A planned variant of the Ke-Ho was the Ku-Se (自走砲 Jisōhō クーセ) self-propelled gun/tank destroyer. J06 Ke Ho  It was to be armed with a Short Type 99 75 mm mountain gun, in a similar open case mate to the planned Ho-Ni and Ho-Ro SPGs. J06 Ke Ho 

==Fate==
In 1942, a prototype vehicle was built, and the project was cancelled soon after. J06 Ke Ho  As with most new tank designs the Japanese came up with, it was low on the list of importance. J06 Ke Ho  Resources and construction efforts were instead being focused on warships and warplanes. J06 Ke Ho  Mass production was approved in 1945 however, but this was of course too late and the one prototype remained the only one built. J06 Ke Ho  This also meant that the Ku-Se variant never left the drawing board. J06 Ke Ho

What happened to the prototype is unknown. J06 Ke Ho  It was likely taken back to the USA for analysis and later broken down. J06 Ke Ho
