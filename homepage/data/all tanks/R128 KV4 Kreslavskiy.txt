|InTheGame_pros=
* Semi-accurate gun with good penetration and shell velocity
* Decent at hull-down; has huge thick gun mantlet and 7° gun depression
* High ammo capacity
* Respectable weight, pretty resistant to ramming
* Can side scrape (preferably on left hand side)


|InTheGame_cons=
* Subpar in all other gun parameters: low DPM, bad movement dispersion and long aim time
* Unreliable armor: big cupola and rounded driver compartment are significant weakspots, hull sides also weaker than the KV-4
* Low mobility and agility, resembling the [[KV-4]] 
* Low HP pool considering its size and weight
* Crew slot matches only its siblings, the [[KV-3]] and the KV-4

An ugly big duck and extremely rare sight on the battlefield it is, but the Kreslavskiy could actually prove more than its own worth in the right hands. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy 
To begin with, the KV designation shall not fool anyone into leading a charge: the machine is simply not suitable for that job, unless coming out top of the matchmaking. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  It has neither the tech tree KV-4's thick all-around armor to shrug off incoming shots, nor the [[KV-5]]'s high damage output to burn through enemy lines. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Instead it works better imitating its German counterpart, the [[Lowe]]'s playstyle: find proper cover, go hull down or side-scrape and support the pushing teammates by dishing out damage '''steadily'''. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  The large ammo reserve might appear abundant and forgiving, but the slow reload rate doesn't allow many chances to convert that into damage dealt. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Still, watch out for TDs and some high-pen HTs; they punch through even the mantlet with ease. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  If caught in less than favorable situations, the Kreslavskiy will of course, suffer badly due to its lacking mobility and questionable durability. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Even Tier VI wolfpacks could swarm its weak sides and gain a kill, not to mention most (if not all) the Tier IX and X directly outclassing it. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Another issue is that, the Kreslavskiy is equipped with an exceptionally poor radio; on certain large maps it's actually possible to lose contact with teammates!

Due to the odd 6-slot crew setup and low damage-making capability, the Kreslavskiy is not an efficient progress grinder. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Yet its unique playstyle among USSR tanks and rare status still grants considerable collection value. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Just make sure one won't regret obtaining it: currently selling this vehicle gains only a laughable amount of credits, making it almost total loss. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy

In April 1941, it was decided to create a project for a new Super-heavy tank. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  It was supposed to be able to defeat any German heavy tank. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  The project was intended to remain an unbuilt design, until it was needed. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Several tank designers were told to create basic concept drawings. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Sources differ as to the designers involved. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Among those listed are: Kreslavsky; Kuzmin, Tarapatin and Tarotko (who together worked on the same design); Pereverzev; Mikhailov; Kruchenykh; Tseits, K. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Buganov; S. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Fedorenko; G. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Kruchenykh; F. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Marishkin; G. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Moskvin; N. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Strukov; A. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Yermolaev; L. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Sychev; L. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Pereverzev; Bykov; N. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Dukhov; M.

Basic armour was to be 125 to 130 mm and up to 150 mm over vulnerable areas. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  A new gun was required. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  There were about 20 different designs generated by the project. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  The lightest design was 82. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy 5 tonnes and the heaviest was 107. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy 7 tonnes. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  All had a 107mm ZiS-6 main gun and all but one had a second tank gun. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  The second gun was a 45 mm 20-K, or a 76 mm gun. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Solutions to the positioning of the guns – turrets or hull mountings – varied. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy  Crew requirements were from 5 to 9 men. R128 KV4 Kreslavskiy
