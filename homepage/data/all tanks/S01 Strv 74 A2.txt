|While it may not have the excellent gun depression angles and dynamics of Swedish mediums, the Strv m/42-57 Alt A. S01 Strv 74 A2 2 (which is quite a mouthful to say) is a great sniper tank. S01 Strv 74 A2  With its ability to inflict high burst damage, and good soft stats (for an autoloader), it can be surprisingly effective if in the hands of a skilled tank commander. S01 Strv 74 A2  Its autoloading gun can do enormous damage even to some softer tier 8's. S01 Strv 74 A2  But the gun often loses potential in tier 7 and tier 8 battles, when the 149 penetration is just not that effective like it is in tier 6 battles. S01 Strv 74 A2

*Great reload of less than 16 seconds with a good crew
*Accurate, powerful gun
*Good penetration
*Relatively small target, especially when compared to other tier 6 mediums
*The well sloped UFP allows for a lucky bounce

|InTheGame_cons=

*Very thin armor and low health pool
*Frequent module damage; the engine can be damaged/destroyed from the front
*Mediocre gun depression and elevation
*Below average mobility for a medium tank

The strv m is one of those cross dressing traps from anime, but tankified. S01 Strv 74 A2  It appears to be a medium tank, but what hides underneath the skirt/armor is one of the best ranged vehicles at tier six, with beautiful swedish bias dispersion and great damage potential to boot. S01 Strv 74 A2  You mostly see it in bushes, with binoculars and a camo net, chipping away at opponent's health before retreating into cover. S01 Strv 74 A2  It CAN brawl, but it shouldn't unless the situation is very dire. S01 Strv 74 A2

|History=
The Stridsvagn m/42 (Strv m/42) was a Swedish medium tank in service during the World War II period and early post-war years. S01 Strv 74 A2  The 22-ton Strv m/42 was developed from improvements to the Lago medium tank, after the Swedish Army specified requirements for a bigger and better tank. S01 Strv 74 A2  The tank was modern in design, well protected and mobile. S01 Strv 74 A2  Initially ordered in November 1941, a total of 287 (including prototypes) were produced from 1941 to 1945. S01 Strv 74 A2 <br> 


The Strv m/42 featured a 75mm L/34 gun, the first gun of its size in a Swedish tank. S01 Strv 74 A2  This gun had similar performance to the German 75mm guns used on early Panzer IV tanks and StuG III assault guns. S01 Strv 74 A2  

Four versions of the Strv m/42 were produced, by AB Landsverk and under license by Volvo. S01 Strv 74 A2  Initially configured with an electromagnetic gearbox, this was replaced by a new hydraulic gearbox. S01 Strv 74 A2  Earlier vehicles were fitted with twin 162hp Scania-Vabis 603 engines, before Volvo developed and equipped its variant with the more powerful 410hp A 8B single engine. S01 Strv 74 A2  

In order to facilitate easy rail transport, the tank was relatively tall and narrow and this meant it had a relatively small turret ring. S01 Strv 74 A2  A project to re-arm the m/42 with a high velocity 75mm was started. S01 Strv 74 A2  This project resulted in the "Delat torn" that was ultimately cancelled in 1947 due to shortcomings of the turret. S01 Strv 74 A2  It wasn't until 1953 that another attempt was proposed since, by then, Sweden had purchased their Centurion tanks (in 1952) and held trials with the AMX 13. S01 Strv 74 A2  The Centurion was chosen over the AMX 13 because of its superior armour, but it was realised that a modern light tank was needed. S01 Strv 74 A2  

Because the development of a native light tank was estimated to take seven years the idea to rebuild the outdated m/42's was chosen. S01 Strv 74 A2  This idea was split into two proposals, whereas the first (A) was split further into three alternatives. S01 Strv 74 A2  The second proposal (B) was to rebuild the m/42's into Pvkv m/43's (or something very close to it), while the first proposal was to replace the turret with something that could hold the high velocity 75mm Lvkan m/37. S01 Strv 74 A2  The first alternative (A. S01 Strv 74 A2 1) was to design a new conventional turret (this was ultimately what was chosen and what became the Strv 74). S01 Strv 74 A2  The third alternative (A. S01 Strv 74 A2 3) was to design a "Delat torn" type turret as had already been tested 1944-1947. S01 Strv 74 A2  The second alternative (A. S01 Strv 74 A2 2) was to design an AMX-type turret. S01 Strv 74 A2  Contrary to popular belief, this option was not to mount the AMX 13 turret onto the m/42 chassi. S01 Strv 74 A2  The A. S01 Strv 74 A2 2 alternative was to "fit the 7. S01 Strv 74 A2 5 cm lvkan in a new, oscillating turret that is in principle similar to the AMX-turret" (Archive reference: SE/KrA/0266/002/01:H/F I/1). S01 Strv 74 A2  This A. S01 Strv 74 A2 2 alternative was only preliminary studied on a quite shallow level to understand, in broad strokes, its pros and cons. S01 Strv 74 A2  As the A. S01 Strv 74 A2 1 alternative was seen as the most promising the A. S01 Strv 74 A2 2 and A. S01 Strv 74 A2 3 alternatives were not further developed, and no design of an oscillating turret was made. S01 Strv 74 A2  How similar this turret would've been to the AMX 13 turret is unknown. S01 Strv 74 A2  Supposedly the AMX-turret was considered for the chassi, but due to the turret ring size could not fit, this is however not mentioned in the 1953 proposal and could not be related to the name "A. S01 Strv 74 A2 2". S01 Strv 74 A2 

The Strv m/42 was phased out of service in 1953. S01 Strv 74 A2  Instead of scrapping the vehicles, the chassis of all strv m/42 tanks with twin Scania-Vabis 603 engines were rebuilt between 1957 and 1960 into the new Stridsvagn 74 tank, and all those with the single Volvo engine A 8B engines were rebuilt as Infanterikanonvagn 73 infantry support vehicles. S01 Strv 74 A2  The turrets were re-used as static gun pillboxes, along major coastlines and harbors. S01 Strv 74 A2
