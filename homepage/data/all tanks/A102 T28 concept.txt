|InTheGame_pros=
* Wide gun traverse, can angle the hull decently and also hide the weak side miniturrets
* Good all around armor, especially on the "turret"
* Surprising acceleration and engine power for its armor
* Great view range, better than the [[T25 AT]] and only bested by the [[T25/2]] and the [[St. A102 T28 concept  Emil]] by 10m
* First premium American TD in the game - can train same class crews without penalty, like the tier 7 M56 Scorpion
|InTheGame_cons=
* Very low penetration and accuracy for a TD, bad gun depression of 4 degrees
* Awful hull traverse speed
* Obvious weakspots at close range in the form of the miniturrets on each side. A102 T28 concept 
* No preferential matchmaking or credit bonus
* Despite being a limited traverse TD, it does have a "turret" that can be damaged and jammed

While armor is great against tier 7 and below, this tank has multiple drawbacks. A102 T28 concept  The armor is great only against opponents who are unfamiliar with the weakspots of the tank (miniturrets which are visible to all sides and angles). A102 T28 concept  Hull armor can be penned from all sides by using premium ammunition by most tanks it meets. A102 T28 concept 

When armor can't be relied on, the health pool is quite low and T28 Concept ends up dead in a couple of shots. A102 T28 concept  Popular Russian 122mm guns can 2-shot this TD on a moderately high damage rolls. A102 T28 concept  And three shot is guaranteed. A102 T28 concept 

Low pen and accuracy by tier 7 standards, not to mention by tank destroyers standards, combined with high ammo cost and non premium credit profile (see accuracy comment) can make losses expensive, especially on non premium account. A102 T28 concept  Also the rate of fire leaves much to be hoped for as low pen and bad accuracy make non damaging shots quite frequent. A102 T28 concept 

Low mobility combined with bad gun depression can make positioning for a shot frustrating. A102 T28 concept 
However, when top tier it makes for a great corner fighter. A102 T28 concept  Using a wall you can angle to hide one of your miniturrets, and the wall will hide the other. A102 T28 concept  The good gun traverse allows you to take a sharp angle, and bounce many standard rounds. A102 T28 concept  It can be an effective city brawler in this way, although you still need support to prevent you from getting outflanked. A102 T28 concept 
 
Finally even the crew training part has a drawback as only the tier ten tank destroyers (T110E3 and T110E4) from the American tree have the same crew layout. A102 T28 concept
