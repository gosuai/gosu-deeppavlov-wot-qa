* The 105mm has relatively good shell velocity compared to other howitzers
* Relatively heavy - Good for ramming other similar tiered medium and light tanks
* Top engine has reduced chance of fire

* Big, boxy yet poorly armored top turret with tumor-style cupola sticking out 
* Stock turret cannot fit the top 75mm or 105mm
* Low top speed and traverse speed compared to other medium at the same tier
* Top 75mm has awful penetration and mediocre accuracy; 105mm gun has lower alpha, penetration, and rate for tier 5. F11 Renault G1R 
* Leading to the [[ARL 44]], different crew setups and no guns carrying over make the grind more difficult. F11 Renault G1R

Your armor will likely hold against low tiered enemies quite well, though is quite unreliable against similar or higher tiered tanks. F11 Renault G1R  It also comes at the price of having much worse speed and maneuverability than almost all other mediums of the same tier. F11 Renault G1R  Thus, this tanks works better as second-line heavy supporter, constantly chipping away hitpoints from enemy heavies as they brawl with your heavies, as well as picking out sneaky light flankers. F11 Renault G1R  Messing with other mediums don't work out well generally: it's plainly too slow to arrive at advantageous positions in time. F11 Renault G1R  To make matters worse, the sluggishness and inferior weaponry won't allow you to outgun most opponents unless running 105mm HEAT rounds with considerable gunnery skill. F11 Renault G1R  Also be ware of being a rather rare sight on the battlefield, some opponents might priorize you for completing Expert: France achievement. F11 Renault G1R 

If you have the 75mm equipped, be prepared for frequent non-penetrations as the gun has exactly 100mm of penetration at 100m. F11 Renault G1R  The APCR has poor penetration as well, with only 129mm of penetration. F11 Renault G1R  Heavily armored vehicles like the [[AT 2]] will cause you problems, so it is advised to equip the 105mm howitzer so you can guarantee damage with High Explosive against any target you come across. F11 Renault G1R  For a last resort, your vehicle weighs about 35 tons - be a battering ram against light tanks and other lighter vehicles in dire situation, though you might not frequently catch up with them. F11 Renault G1R  In comparison, the [[M4 Sherman]] weighs 30 tons. F11 Renault G1R  If you are to ram a Sherman, you are more often to be better off than the Sherman will be. F11 Renault G1R

|History= 

The Char G1 was a French replacement project for the Char D2 medium tank. F11 Renault G1R  Several prototypes from different companies were developed since 1936, but not a single one had been fully completed at the time of the Fall of France in 1940. F11 Renault G1R  The projects represented some of the most advanced French tank design of the period and finally envisaged a type that would have been roughly equal in armament and mobility to later World War II standard tanks of other nations, such as early models of the Soviet T-34 and the American M4 Sherman, but possessing several novel features, such as gun stabilization, a semi-automatic loader and an optical rangefinder. F11 Renault G1R 


In 1935, the French ''Infanterie'' still lacked a satisfactory medium tank. F11 Renault G1R  While a reasonably effective heavy breakthrough tank in the form of the Char B1 was available, as well as several light infantry tanks about to enter production (namely, the Renault R35, Hotchkiss H35 and FCM 36), the only medium tanks available were the disappointing Renault Char D1 and only slightly improved Renault Char D2. F11 Renault G1R  At least 250 medium tanks would be needed to equip the planned organic tank battalions of the five mechanized infantry divisions, which would be the main ''Infanterie'' force for executing strategic offensive and defensive operations. F11 Renault G1R  The ''Cavalerie'' already had a good medium tank in the form of the SOMUA S 35, but the ''Infanterie'' rejected it for use on account of the S 35's limited climbing capabilities. F11 Renault G1R  Inter-service rivalry also played a role in this rejection, as the ''Infanterie'' wished to assert its dominance over the ''Cavalerie'' in the field of tank design. F11 Renault G1R  


==The Twenty-Tonne Tank==

Thus, on 18 December, the ''Infanterie'' issued its first specifications for a ''Char Moyen d'Infanterie de 20 tonnes'' ("20 tonne medium infantry tank"). F11 Renault G1R  The specifications called for a road speed of 50 km/h, an off-road speed of 20 km/h, a range of 400 km, trench crossing capability of 2 m, a wading depth of 120 cm, climbing capability of 80 cm and 45° slope. F11 Renault G1R  Armament was to consist of a 47 mm gun and a 7. F11 Renault G1R 5 mm machine gun, with an armor thickness of 40 mm. F11 Renault G1R  The hull was to be completely sealed against chemical weapons, and a radio was required. F11 Renault G1R  The weight limit of 20 metric tonnes was stipulated because of railroad, bridge-carrying, and pontoon capacity constraints. F11 Renault G1R 

In May 1936, the ''Conseil Consultatif de l'Armement'' invited French industry to initiate design studies for the new 20 tonne tank. F11 Renault G1R  However, at the same time it was increasingly realized that the Char B1 was overly complex and expensive, and was 2 tonnes heavier than necessary due to the use of riveted armor plate instead of more modern welding and casting techniques. F11 Renault G1R  The 20 tonne tank promised to be lighter, more mobile, cheaper and easier to produce, and also easier to train crews on. F11 Renault G1R  It was thus decided that the 20 tonne tank would also serve as the future ''char bataille'' ("battle tank") of the ''Infanterie'', replacing the Char B1. F11 Renault G1R  The specifications were subsequently changed in October, calling for protection equivalent to that of the Char B1 (60 mm all around), increased trench crossing capability (250 cm), and armament of a high velocity gun capable of eliminating all expected enemy medium tanks as well as two machine guns. F11 Renault G1R  The other requirements remained the same. F11 Renault G1R  These specifications were highly ambitious, and the vehicle promised to be the most potent and modern French tank yet developed. F11 Renault G1R  This also meant that development would take some time, as the tank was too advanced for French industry at the time. F11 Renault G1R  

==Char G==

At the same time, debate was raging about the future use of the tank in the ''Infanterie''. F11 Renault G1R  On one side were officers like Charles de Gaulle, who proposed that the ''Infanterie'' raise its own armored divisions similar to the DLMs (''Divisions Légères Mécaniques'' - "Mechanized Light Divisions") of the ''Cavalerie'' or the German ''Panzerdivisionen'' - balanced forces with organic mechanised infantry and artillery, flexible enough to fulfill all possible tactical roles. F11 Renault G1R  More conservative officers opposed imitating the ''Cavalerie'' and insisted that the ''Infanterie'' should stick to its traditional role, that of the breakthrough. F11 Renault G1R  Some wanted the limited funds to be spent on producing a sufficient number of light infantry tanks to give each division its own organic tank battalion. F11 Renault G1R  Others contended that only heavy tanks should be built. F11 Renault G1R  The 20 tonne tank, now known as the Char G, was intended to be both mobile and heavily armored enough to spearhead breakthroughs, and only made sense if used in German-style armored divisions. F11 Renault G1R  Until the debate was settled, the future of the Char G remained uncertain. F11 Renault G1R 

Despite this, French industry was very interested in the Char G project, as it promised to become France's major tank-building program. F11 Renault G1R  With it would come lucrative state investments at a time when French industry was still reeling from the effects of the Great Depression. F11 Renault G1R  Seven companies submitted designs between late 1936 and early 1937: ''Établissements Baudet-Donon-Roussel'' (BDR), ''Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée'' (FCM), ''Renault'', ''Fouga'', ''Lorraine de Dietrich'', ''Société d'Études et d'Applications Mécaniques'' (SEAM), and ''Société d'Outillage Mécanique et d'Usinage d'Artillerie'' (SOMUA). F11 Renault G1R  Reports were issued on each of the proposals, only SEAM and Renault's projects were sufficiently advanced for construction of prototypes to be approved, their good connections with the French military having allowed them to begin design work even before the specifications had been officially issued. F11 Renault G1R  The proposals of BDR, ''Lorraine de Dietrich'', and ''Fouga'' were kept under consideration until further studies on their feasibility had been completed. F11 Renault G1R  On the instigation of Prince André Poniatowski, head of a design bureau subcontracted by SEAM, the Char G specifications were changed in November 1937 to require a hull-mounted 75 mm gun as the Char G's primary armament, which was unsurprisingly a feature of SEAM's proposal. F11 Renault G1R  This caused many problems for the other competitors, as their designs had no room for such a large weapon in the hull. F11 Renault G1R  This change in requirement, along with the increase in armor demanded added about 4 tonnes to the designs, and as of 20 February 1937, none of the designs met the weight limit of 20 tonnes, and were projected at 23-35 tonnes. F11 Renault G1R  Louis Renault's design featured a 75 mm gun mounted in a turret, and back in 1936 he had proposed this arrangement as an alternative, which was well-received. F11 Renault G1R  Capitalizing on this, he bribed a high-ranking officer of the ''Direction de l'Infanterie'' to change the design requirements yet again, this time making a 75 mm gun in the turret mandatory. F11 Renault G1R  This forced Renault's competitors to completely redesign their proposals, giving Renault a huge advantage and inevitably causing large and, as Renault hoped, fatal delays to the competition's proposals. F11 Renault G1R 

==Char G1==

By late 1937, the project had been renamed Char G1, and all prototypes then authorized received official designations: G1 L (Lorraine), G1 R (Renault), G1 B (BDR), G1 F (Fouga), G1 P (SEAM). F11 Renault G1R  The SOMUA and FCM projects had been discontinued for being too vague or lacking innovation, along with the fact that these two companies had their hands full manufacturing other types. F11 Renault G1R  On 1 February 1938, the ''Direction de l'Infanterie'' issued a third major change to the specifications. F11 Renault G1R  The maximum weight was increased to 35 tonnes in order to fit the 75 mm APX 32-calibre gun in a turret (known as the 75 mm SA32 in-game). F11 Renault G1R  The ever-changing design requirements caused most companies to slow the design process, as they were unwilling to invest much money in an ever more complex project with uncertain prospects. F11 Renault G1R  In order to speed up the process, on  8 June 1938 Maurice Lavirotte of the ''Atelier de Construction de Rueil'' (ARL), the French Army's workshop, was dispatched to assist the companies with construction. F11 Renault G1R  If armor plate was not available for the companies, boiler plate was permitted in the construction of the prototypes. F11 Renault G1R 

==New Specifications==

On 12 July 1938 a much more detailed list of specifications was given. F11 Renault G1R  In general they called for a tank that was powerfully armed, immune to standard anti-tank guns and possessed excellent tactical and strategic mobility. F11 Renault G1R  In detail, the specifications demanded a long, high velocity, semi-automatic 75 mm 32-calibre gun as the main armament; a 7. F11 Renault G1R 5mm machine gun in the turret that can also serve as an anti-aircraft weapon, a machine gun in the front of the hull or the turret, a minimum ammunition load of 100 rounds for the main gun and 30 magazines for the machine guns, an empty weight of 30 and a combat weight of 32 tonnes. F11 Renault G1R  The engine was to be able to be both electrically and manually started, while the tracks were to be fully accessible. F11 Renault G1R  A maximum speed of 40 km/h (average 30 km/h) on roads and 20 km/h offroad was required. F11 Renault G1R  Two fuel tanks were to give a range of 200 km or 8 hours endurance off-road. F11 Renault G1R  Climbing capability was demanded to be 90 cm and 85% on a solid or 65% on a wet slope, while trench-crossing capability was to be 250 cm and the wading depth would be 120 cm. F11 Renault G1R  For the first time, dimensional limits were also set: the width was to not exceed 294 cm to facilitate rail transport, the absolute height of the fighting compartment was to not exceed 120 cm, but yet be sufficient to hold a side door. F11 Renault G1R  With regards to the gas-proof armor, the demanded thickness remained at 60 mm, but the use an appliqué armor was forbidden. F11 Renault G1R  The armor could be cast — with the sections connected by bolts or, preferably, gudgeons, or electrically welded. F11 Renault G1R  Automatic fire extinguishers were also required. F11 Renault G1R  The crew were to have advanced vision and fire-control equipment. F11 Renault G1R  The cupola, armed with the secondary 7. F11 Renault G1R 5 mm machine gun, was to have have a large episcope to which the main turret was slaved, allowing the commander to lay the 75 mm gun on the target himself. F11 Renault G1R  The cupola would also be fitted with an optical telemetric rangefinder. F11 Renault G1R  The gun was to be a 32-calibre 75 mm gun. F11 Renault G1R  Despite its short length, the gun would have good armor penetration using Brandt tungsten armor piercing sub-caliber ammunition. F11 Renault G1R  None of the projects in the summer of 1938 could meet these specifications without a fundamental redesign. F11 Renault G1R  

In France during the 1930s, tank turrets were usually designed separately from tank hulls, in order to serve as standard types usable on many different vehicles. F11 Renault G1R  On 1 June 1938 the commission determined that three teams, those of ARL, FCM, and Renault, were to develop new turrets capable of being fitted to the Char G1 under the new specifications. F11 Renault G1R  They were invited to make the necessary changes and consider existing or new high velocity 75 mm guns. F11 Renault G1R  In July 1939, ARL produced a prototype of both a turret, the 5. F11 Renault G1R 7 tonne ARL 3 fitted with a turret-basket and having a turret ring diameter of 188 cm, and a 75 mm gun, which had been developed for the FCM F1 super heavy tank project. F11 Renault G1R  Similarly, FCM developed a modified 7. F11 Renault G1R 5 tonne version of the welded octagonal auxiliary turret on the FCM F1, equipped with an advanced semiautomatic loader and a turret ring diameter of 185 cm. F11 Renault G1R  As a low-risk project, FCM also developed the welded, octagonal F4 turret that had been developed from that of the Char 2C super heavy tank, and was equipped with the ubiquitous 75 mm mle. F11 Renault G1R  1897 field gun. F11 Renault G1R  


==Development of Renault's proposal==

The Renault G1 represents the proposal sent by Louis Renault, who was very interested in the development of the Char G1 due to it competing with his company's Char D2 and B1 tanks. F11 Renault G1R  He was also interested in restoring the company's reputation after the failure of the AMC 34 and 35 along with other complaints of the reliability of his other tanks. F11 Renault G1R 

Renault's intial proposal was submitted on December 10, 1936, and it complied with the initial requirements for a 20-ton tank. F11 Renault G1R  This proposal was based on the Renault R35, and had a similar smooth curved cast hull to that of the light infantry tank but was much wider and had six road wheels and double tracks per side — to avoid having to design a new broad track. F11 Renault G1R  It had a modern torsion bar suspension and, similarly to the competing Char G1 proposal sent by Lorraine de Dietrich, had a (rather outdated) Cleveland transmission. F11 Renault G1R  The suspension protection plates formed an integral part with the hull's main armour. F11 Renault G1R 

The hull was crowned by a flat-domed cast superstructure that superficially resembled a circular conventional turret. F11 Renault G1R  In reality however it was at first planned to be fixed; the 47 mm gun was supposed to traverse through a horizontal slit like in a pill-box, rotating on a pivot fixed to the hull floor, a proposal made by Colonel Balland. F11 Renault G1R  In a second version of this design by engineer Jean Restany, the "pseudo-turret" was traversable, but simply carried along by the electrically driven gun-mount; the turret therefore would not have to be equipped with a heavy gun-mantlet and, not bearing the weight of the armament, could be much lighter. F11 Renault G1R  On the right side of the superstructure a vertical cylinder protruded, on top of which a small rotating commander's cupola was fitted, that was armed with dual co-axial machine guns. F11 Renault G1R  The superstructure, with the commander/gunner on the right and the loader on the left, had sufficient room to hold a Schneider 47 mm antitank gun that was much more powerful than the shorter 47 mm SA 35 gun equipping the standard APX1 and APX4 turrets. F11 Renault G1R  Expecting that this superior firepower would give his design a clear advantage leading to a quick production contract, as had so often happened in the past, Renault was unpleasantly surprised when lobbying by Poniatowski contributed to a change in specifications to the effect that a 75 mm gun had to be carried in the hull. F11 Renault G1R  The ACK1 hull was simply too flat for this. F11 Renault G1R  To save his project Renault started a strong counter-lobby. F11 Renault G1R  Part of this was proposing, already on 10 December 1936, that as an alternative option the turret should hold a longer (at least L/29) main 75 mm armament. F11 Renault G1R  It was also claimed that the weight of the projects, 24 tonnes, could be reduced to 19. F11 Renault G1R 6 tonnes by limiting the armament to a single gun. F11 Renault G1R 

The commission in 1937 was hesitant about the torsion-bar suspension, and rejected the Cleveland transmission and double-track feature. F11 Renault G1R  It also concluded that weight would be at least 25 tonnes. F11 Renault G1R  Nevertheless, an order for a prototype was made, in view of the innovative armament mounting. F11 Renault G1R 

The specification change of 1 February 1938 was much in favour of Renault, as the other companies needed a very fundamental redesign of their projects to meet the new demands, whereas the ACK1 with its broad fighting compartment could easily accommodate a wide turret as it was. F11 Renault G1R  Renault also promised that his tank could be taken into production in 1940, a year earlier than the Char G1L, so the latter project could be replaced by his Char G1R as the main development type. F11 Renault G1R 

At this moment however it was recognized by the commission that the weight estimate earlier made by the bribed Infantry officer had been a deliberate falsehood and that the best that could be expected was 28 tonnes. F11 Renault G1R  Also the claimed first production date, that had already led to a limiting of Char B1 bis orders, later was proven to be wildly optimistic. F11 Renault G1R  In April 1938 Renault claimed that weight could yet be saved by perpetuating the feature of the torsion-bar suspension, limiting the crew to four and keeping the ammunition load to its bare minimum. F11 Renault G1R  The commission decided however to bring the weight limit of the project to thirty tonnes, as this was in line with the other projects and the planned inner hull side armour (located below fifty millimetres external suspension protection plates) of ten millimetres was deemed too thin. F11 Renault G1R  The weight advantage in relation to the rival designs thus largely disappeared. F11 Renault G1R 

In the summer of 1938 a further problem for the Renault design materialised in that the new demand was made that the turret should hold a stabilised gun and a telemetric rangefinder, features to which the cast turret could not be easily adapted. F11 Renault G1R  As the 2. F11 Renault G1R 5 tonne pseudo-turret was moved about by the gun barrel, its momentum tended to disturb the sight-laying. F11 Renault G1R  This problem was solved in 1939 with the help of APX, which designed a system in which the vertical axis of the gun mount was directly connected to the turret roof. F11 Renault G1R  At the same time the troublesome Cleveland transmission was abandoned. F11 Renault G1R  Overall the Renault design process in the years 1938 and 1939 was very slow. F11 Renault G1R 

On 10 September 1939 the Char G1R was the only one of the projects that was to be further developed, probably because the Renault company was exceptional in having reserve production capacity left. F11 Renault G1R 

==Alternate Turret development==

In France during the thirties, generally tank turrets were designed separately from tank hulls, to serve as standard types applicable to many different vehicles. F11 Renault G1R  On 1 June 1938 the commission determined that three teams, those of ARL, FCM and Renault, were in the process of developing new turrets capable of being fitted on the Char G1 under the new specifications. F11 Renault G1R  These were invited to make the necessary changes and research existing or new suitably-high-velocity 75 mm guns. F11 Renault G1R 

In July 1939 ARL was developing prototypes of both a turret, the 5. F11 Renault G1R 7 tonne ARL 3 fitted with a turret-basket and having a turret ring diameter of 188 cm, and a gun, also in the context of the FCM F1 project. F11 Renault G1R  FCM was considering use of a revised 7. F11 Renault G1R 5 tonne version of the welded octagonal auxiliary turret of the heavy FCM F1, to be equipped with an advanced semi-automatic loader and having a turret ring diameter of 185 cm. F11 Renault G1R  As a fallback plan, FCM also was considering the use of the similarly octagonal and welded F4 turret, developed from that of the Char 2C and equipped with the standard 75 mm field gun.
