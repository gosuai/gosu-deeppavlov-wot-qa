The T-34-3 has high alpha and gives this tank very good damage potential. Ch14 T34 3  Penetration is poor so use the mobility to flank and get to sides of heavy tanks. Ch14 T34 3  Unfortunately accuracy of the Chinese gun is even lower than similar Soviet guns. Ch14 T34 3 

Turret armor is strong like similar tanks. Ch14 T34 3  One of the best ways to play this tank is to find a shell hole or depression in the ground and sit it in while only exposing your turret armor and watching the other teams shots just bounce. Ch14 T34 3  (Just remember to move before arty gets you). Ch14 T34 3  If you can't find a hole to hide in, play carefully as your hull armor while good, it won't save you in a brawl with other tanks. Ch14 T34 3  If you do find yourself in a brawl, try to keep your very thin side armor covered so they have to shoot your turret. Ch14 T34 3  Also try not to get flanked as while you have decent mobility, other tanks have better and can circle you to death by shooting you weak side armor. Ch14 T34 3  With your low pen with basic ammo, try to hit weak spots or shoot tanks in the side. Ch14 T34 3  If you try to circle them, don't get tracked or you will die fast as your reload is slow compared to other tanks. Ch14 T34 3  

Facehugging can be a viable tactic while using this tank, especially against opponents with bad gun depression. Ch14 T34 3 

Because of its long reload, having a shell rammer is a must for this tank. Ch14 T34 3  Other than that it's advisable to try to improve your aim time and equip a Vertical Stabilizer and Enhanced Gun Laying Drive. Ch14 T34 3  

Also should be noted that this tank has very good camouflage values. Ch14 T34 3  Training crew with camo skills can keep the tank hidden until its gun is fired. Ch14 T34 3  Training Brothers in Arms for all crew gives extra 5% crew skill which helps slightly with aiming time, accuracy and reload. Ch14 T34 3
