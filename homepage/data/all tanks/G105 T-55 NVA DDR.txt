* Vastly superior ground resistance to the T-54 while retaining the same power to weight ratio
* Retains excellent turret and side armor of the T-54
* Slightly better view range than the T-54
* Above-average sized HP pool, tied for 2nd in tier

|InTheGame_cons=
* Weaker hull armor than T-54, similar to [[WZ-120]]
* Lower top speed than the T-54
* Bad gun depression and even worse elevation. G105 T-55 NVA DDR 
* Prone to driver death and ammo rack damage
* Doesn't work well as credit OR crew grinder due to high ammo cost and unique crew setup

The T 55A is similar to the T-54, yet has more in common with the [[T-62A]]. G105 T-55 NVA DDR  The noticeably weaker hull armor doesn't allow you to be as aggressive as in a T-54, however, your turret armor and side armor are the same, so you still can sidescrape or stay hull down if possible and needed. G105 T-55 NVA DDR  Your superior gun handling gives you the edge and makes snap shots extremely potent and likely to hit even on the move. G105 T-55 NVA DDR  Therefore, you should focus more on flanking and quick snap shots, however, your short aim time combined with the very good accuracy also makes long range fights a real option. G105 T-55 NVA DDR  If caught in a close encounter, fear not -- the D-10T2S gun also has a high rate of fire only seconded by the same gun on the T-54 (that doesn't handle really well), the Obj. G105 T-55 NVA DDR  430 II (which is a sniping tank with limited gun traverse, not so competitive in this case) or a few smaller calibre guns on other tanks. G105 T-55 NVA DDR  There will always be some advantage to exploit: either to trade, to simply outgun, or to land the crucial first shot with more precision. G105 T-55 NVA DDR  

The reduced top speed in comparison is perceptible, but not dramatic. G105 T-55 NVA DDR  In most cases, your quick acceleration and very good terrain resistance values make you no less as mobile. G105 T-55 NVA DDR 

Beware of ammo costs - this tank is not a true "premium", it is just a reward "Elite" tank with the ability to train crews from other German mediums, and still retains very expensive ammo like the T-54. G105 T-55 NVA DDR  Especially premium ammo. G105 T-55 NVA DDR  Shooting pure premium ammo will burn your credits considerably faster than any other tank in the game. G105 T-55 NVA DDR
