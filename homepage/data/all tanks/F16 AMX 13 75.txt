The AMX 13 75 is an evolution of the design concepts introduced with the AMX 12t. F16 AMX 13 75  It keeps the good parts and fixes most of the flaws. F16 AMX 13 75  Once upgraded, the improved accuracy of the gun allows for long-range firing, when desired. F16 AMX 13 75  The wider tracks possibly improve off-road performance slightly. F16 AMX 13 75  As with the AMX 12t, this tank is primarily a flanker. F16 AMX 13 75  Use it to attack the side and rear, and finish off injured enemy tanks. F16 AMX 13 75  Its main weaknesses are its weak armor and low penetration for its tier. F16 AMX 13 75  Try not to play with heavies. F16 AMX 13 75  With only three crew, a crew injury is often devastating. F16 AMX 13 75  A First Aid kit is highly recommended. F16 AMX 13 75  Be careful as you are outclassed by many other of your peers in almost every statistic. F16 AMX 13 75  Playing passively will reward you towards end game, where there will be wounded, alone tanks which you can clean up easily with your autoloader. F16 AMX 13 75 

The time it takes to reload the drum with a full 100% crew and Improved Ventilation is around 12 seconds. F16 AMX 13 75  This is able to be shortened further by Directives, Strong Coffee (a Premium consumable) and Brothers in Arms. F16 AMX 13 75  

It's also worth noting that the enemy often tries to destroy the AMX 13 75 as soon as possible. F16 AMX 13 75  This is similar to the [[T71]]. F16 AMX 13 75  However, this deficiency can be reversed and used to your team's advantage. F16 AMX 13 75  That is, divert the attention of the enemy towards you until your allies take the position. F16 AMX 13 75  

Stock, this tank doesn't have sufficient weight capacity for any equipment other than Coated Optics, since it doesn't weigh anything. F16 AMX 13 75  The Tank Gun Rammer is unavailable on this tank. F16 AMX 13 75  A Gun Laying Drive is useful for faster aiming. F16 AMX 13 75  Fans of passive scouting can equip a Camouflage Net. F16 AMX 13 75 

Unfortunately, with the addition of the [[T71]], this tank is almost useless practically when compared to almost every aspect of each other. F16 AMX 13 75  Make use of APCR a lot, play more passively until late game, and make use of your good camo to stay alive and keep contributing to your team. F16 AMX 13 75 

Luckily, the next tank, the Bat. F16 AMX 13 75 -Châtillon 12 t will reward you greatly. F16 AMX 13 75

== Design and Features ==
The tank was designed at the Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux in 1946 to meet a requirement for an air-portable vehicle to support paratroopers, the first prototype ran from 1948.

F16 AMX 13 75  In 1964 production was transferred to Creusot-Loire at Chalon-sur-Saône, as the ARE moved to building the AMX 30 MBT, and the numbers produced declined significantly. F16 AMX 13 75
