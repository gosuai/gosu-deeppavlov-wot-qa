Plays very similar to the in-game [[T-34-85]]. R108 T34 85M  The front armor is much thicker than the stock tanks with the same sloping, allowing a surprising number of bounces that the standard [[T-34]] would have eaten. R108 T34 85M  As the historical description alludes to, the suspension/tracks were the weak point, making this tank slightly less mobile than the standard -85. R108 T34 85M  This makes turning and maneuvering seem sluggish, although if you are using it as a crew trainer for your upper-tier crew the added skills and perks should mitigate this. R108 T34 85M  As to crew training, the tank contains the same crew slots as the regular -85. R108 T34 85M  This means if you've left the low tiers behind you will have to find a Radio Operator to fill that slot. R108 T34 85M  All in all this tank plays like the [[M4A3E2 Sherman Jumbo|E2]] version of the [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]], whereas the regular T-34-85 is closer to the [[M4A3E8 Sherman|E8]]. R108 T34 85M  
Compared to the other premium Soviet tier 6 medium tank, the [[T-34-85 Rudy]], the T-34-85M has less mobility, but better DPM and hull armor and a slightly better camo-rating and radio range. R108 T34 85M  The T-34-85M also has a five-men crew, which makes it a more effective crew trainer. R108 T34 85M
