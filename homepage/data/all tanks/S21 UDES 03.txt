|The '''UDES 03''' is the first of the Swedish tank destroyers that features hydraulic suspension, where one can switch between two modes -- Travel Mode, which offers great mobility but sacrifices gun handling, and Siege Mode, that offers great gun handling in exchange for mobility. S21 UDES 03 

The UDES was nicknamed "Mountain Goat" for its ability to climb over rough hills and some hard terrain that is normally rarely accessible with other tanks. S21 UDES 03   Some might use its advantage by sniping on high hills (hills on the northern side of the Redshire map for example) that provide great terrain protection and a sniping spot for this vehicle. S21 UDES 03 

Unfortunately the UDES is fairly hard to maneuver. S21 UDES 03   Its heavily sloped armour can easily be overmatched by 61mm+ caliber guns. S21 UDES 03   Combined with its absolutely horrible mobility in siege mode, this won't help you deal with flankers and also makes the UDES a priority target for SPG's. S21 UDES 03 

To shine in the UDES 03 players must know when and where they will position. S21 UDES 03   Use your great mobility in travel mode to relocate yourself from enemies when you feel unsafe and use your great gun handling in siege mode to destroy enemy tanks. S21 UDES 03

|InTheGame_pros= 
- Great gun handling (while in Siege Mode), loses only about 10mm of penetration even at 500m range

- Amazing gun elevation and depression in Siege Mode

- Best camouflage value in Tier V+ -- can reach up to 70% while stationary, and great camouflage when moving (can reach to more than 30%, which is even better than some Tier VIII light tanks)

- Upgraded gun has highest penetration standard rounds at Tier VIII (even at Tier IX) and 1450m/s shell velocity, making it easy to hit targets at long range

- Very high top forward and reversing speeds, great power to weight ratio and maneuverability in Travel Mode

- Low terrain resistances combined with great mobility allow this vehicle to climb some rough terrain (including some areas that cannot be accessed with other vehicles) with ease

- The tank can stand up on its tracks, thanks to the gun elevation and hull depression. S21 UDES 03   This allows shooting above small walls and cover. S21 UDES 03   (see 'Performance' below on how to do this)

|InTheGame_cons= <br />
- Prone to engine damage with hits to the front-mounted engine, which leads to frequent fires and lengthens transition time in and out of Siege Mode<br />

- It rotates much more slowly when in Siege Mode than the Strv S1 (due to the traverse speed while not moving)<br />
 
- It has the second-lowest HP pool for non-SPG vehicles in the same tier (1000) and is very vulnerable against high-caliber guns and SPG's, especially in Siege Mode

- Mobility in Siege Mode is terrible -- 5km/h both forwards and backwards -- and makes it very vulnerable in close range combat

- It will nearly always be penetrated because of the overmatch (HE doesn't apply so arty can't overmatch) rules (>61mm) comparing to the premium Strv S1 (>120mm) -- that's ''(all but 59-16, MT-25 and Setter stock guns and artillery)'' the T6 to T10 guns!  Highly vulnerable to HE rounds

- Lack of gun depression in Travel Mode

- Mediocre aiming time (3 seconds) when outside Siege Mode

- Low ammo capacity (48 rounds for stock gun and 40 rounds for top gun)

- No horizontal gun arc makes it hard to hit mobile targets (because it must move all the time and loses accuracy); can't shoot mobile targets if tracks get destroyed

- Despite having high nominal penetration your shots will bounce a lot when shooting (sometimes even slightly) angled armor at Tiers VIII-X, due to APCR rounds having lower normalization than AP. S21 UDES 03   Shoot flat sections whenever possible or you will get frustrated at times

- Low hull traverse rate at stock

|InTheGame_performance= This tank, along with the 103-0 and 103B, are the main true sniper tanks. S21 UDES 03   Use Travel Mode to get to a good spot and set up Siege in a bush. S21 UDES 03   As long as you don't get spotted, dealing 3-5k damage in a game is easy (as top tier). S21 UDES 03  

Tip to use low cover effectively: Hide behind cover, activate siege, aim low (that raises your butt) and then straight. S21 UDES 03   That raises your gun above cover so that you can fire. S21 UDES 03   Undo Siege to lower your whole tank to get back under cover. S21 UDES 03   Repeat. S21 UDES 03 

|InTheGame_research= 
- '''Tracks''': The basic chassis allows you to install the "top" gun, but it will have to be delayed with the installation of a new engine and improved radio due to the increase in the mass of new modules

- '''The gun''': The "top" gun 10,5cm kan UDES 03 has excellent penetration with a base projectile of 288mm, a nice damage per shot of 390 and slightly lower DPM compared to the 9cm kan m/F

- '''The engine''': The "top" engine will give 50 h. S21 UDES 03 p. S21 UDES 03  and decrease the chance of a fire by 2%, however it will slightly increase the weight of the machine itself, which is critical when using the "stock" tracks

- '''Radio''': The Ra 400 "walk-through" radio will give 710 meters of communication range. S21 UDES 03   The Ra 450 radio gives 850 meters range. S21 UDES 03

BACKGROUND
In the early 70s, the Swedish army was granted 1,8 million kronor (8 million USD) for the development of a light AFV family during the 1971-1975 period. S21 UDES 03  As part of this project, the army set up a number of research groups. S21 UDES 03  The most important of these were UDES, which was based at the Defense Materiel Administration (FMV), and headed by Sven Berge (the engineer behind the S-tank concept). S21 UDES 03 

The role of UDES was to gather, process and coordinate information regarding armored fighting vehicles. S21 UDES 03  Which would serve as a technological-economical overview in that field. S21 UDES 03  In practice the UDES group would develop and catalogue different conceptual alternatives for new Tanks, TD’s and APC’s. S21 UDES 03  The funding behind the project was only half of what the army deemed necessary. S21 UDES 03  Because of this FMV decided to outsource parts of the development to Bofors and Hägglunds, which were experienced with AFV development. S21 UDES 03 

HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT

Initial studies focused on the development of a cheap tank in the 20 ton range that would be able to use interchangeable parts in the planned light vehicle family. S21 UDES 03  To keep costs down, a large extent of the components used had to be existing and commercially available. S21 UDES 03  A power to weight ratio of 30hp/t and a crew of two (later three) men was also a major requirement. S21 UDES 03  Later on, these requirements would lead to three different lines of development including Turretless, Conventional and Remote turret vehicles. S21 UDES 03 


OBJEKT 2013 A

[[File:Objekt_2013A_blueprints. S21 UDES 03 jpg]]

The first of these to be examined was a light turretless vehicle that had already been in development since 1970 under the name Objekt 2013 A. S21 UDES 03  The vehicle was essentially a miniaturized Strv 103 but with one major difference, a gun capable of elevating and depressing independently of the hull. S21 UDES 03  Its main advantage over a fixed gun design was easier movement in terrain and that it was possible to stabilize the main gun. S21 UDES 03  The Vehicle was re-designated UDES 03 as per the naming conventions of the UDES research group. S21 UDES 03 

 

PBV 302 BASED TEST RIG

[[File:PBV_302_Based_Test_Rig. S21 UDES 03 jpg]]

To test the concept, a wood mock up was fitted to the side of a Pbv 302 APC in early 1971. S21 UDES 03  During the tests it was uncovered that the gun would block the field of view when elevated along with other potential problems. S21 UDES 03  Still the results proved that the concept was viable and a order was made for two test rigs. S21 UDES 03  Bofors would handle the construction and testing of a “shooting rig” for testing the main armament, and Hägglunds would do the same for a mobility test rig. S21 UDES 03 

 

SHOOTING RIG

[[File:UDES_Shooting_Rig. S21 UDES 03 jpg]]

In 1973, both test rigs were finished and readied for testing. S21 UDES 03  These prototypes made use of parts from the Pbv 302, such as the tracks and roadwheels although they were later refitted with more durable roadwheels. S21 UDES 03  The shooting rig was externally powered by a electric powerplant and was armed with a cut down 105mm gun for testing. S21 UDES 03  The tests found several faults with the design. S21 UDES 03  The vehicle would regularly throw its tracks when aiming and tracking a target was almost impossible unless on hard terrain due to faults with the suspension. S21 UDES 03 

 

MOBILITY RIG

[[File:UDES_Mobility_Rig. S21 UDES 03 jpg]]

Comparatively the mobility rig was a more complete vehicle. S21 UDES 03  Unlike the other test rig it was powered by a internal diesel engine. S21 UDES 03  One of its stranger design elements was the exhaust which vented underneath the vehicle which was done to reduce the infrared signature. S21 UDES 03  This 12 ton vehicle was used to test the terrain passability under different conditions. S21 UDES 03 

 

BOFORS PROPOSALS

[[File:Bofors_UDES_proposals. S21 UDES 03 jpg]]

Based on the requirements set by UDES and data gained from the trials Bofors and Hägglunds, a number of proposals for both alternative developments and improvements to the vehicles were submitted. S21 UDES 03 

 

HÄGGLUNDS PROPOSALS

[[File:Hagglunds_proposals_UDES. S21 UDES 03 jpg]]

In may 1973, during one of the UDES group meetings it was suggested that a turreted alternative to the UDES 03 should be considered. S21 UDES 03  The turreted design would have to be in the same price and weight range as the UDES 03 and use the same main armament. S21 UDES 03  This turreted light tank would be called UDES 14. S21 UDES 03  This would a shift focus away from the UDES 03 and its development was largely discontinued after 1973 in favor of turreted and later remote turret alternatives. S21 UDES 03 

LEGACY
Although the development of the UDES 03 was discontinued the experience gained from its test rigs would be used in the development of the CV90 armored fighting vehicle and the Strv 2000 project. S21 UDES 03  The fate of the shooting rig is unknown, however the mobility test rig was last seen in the 1990s rotting away at a military scrapyard. S21 UDES 03
