|It was granted as a gift to those that were of service to WG early in WoT's development and is rather rare in battle. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  It is identical in all ways to the [[Pz. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa Kpfw. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  V/IV]] but with the Greek Alpha symbol. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  It's based on a [[Pz. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa Kpfw. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  V Panther]] hull with turret from the [[Pz. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa Kpfw. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  IV Ausf. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  H|Pz. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  IV Ausf. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  H]]. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  Many players think it's similar to a buffed [[Pz. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa Kpfw. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  III/IV]]. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  It has great mobility, decent acceleration and is well armored for its tier. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  Its weakness, however, is that it has very little turret armor, so a single well-placed howitzer or artillery shell will cause major damage.

The Pz. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa Kpfw. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  V/IV Alpha's speed and decent turret traverse make this tank an effective flanker. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  The 7. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa 5cm KWK L/48's penetration is on the lower side of all tier V medium tanks so getting around to the heavier enemies' sides and rear is vital. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  The Pz. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa Kpfw. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  V/IV Alpha has exceptionally good gun handling, allowing it to make use of the good rate of fire.

|History=
From July to September 1942, MAN produced two prototypes, only one of which was fitted with a turret. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa   (It is believed that this turret was taken from a Panzer IV with its 75mm KwK 40 L/43 gun. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  All future Panther tanks mounted at least the 75mm KwK 42 L/70 gun. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  This tank is the one listed above and is sometimes referred to as the V2. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa ) These were extensively tested and proved prone to many technical problems. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  At the same time, a first order for 1,000 tanks was placed, with the first tank expected in early 1943. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  In late 1942, a small pre-production series of 20 tanks was ordered. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  This was the Null-Serie, or Zero Series. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  Those 20 tanks were designated Panzerkampfwagen V Panther Ausfuehrung A and were technically different from later Ausf A production models. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  All were lightly armored with 60mm frontal armor and armed with the early version of the 75mm KwK 42 L/70 gun. G32 PzV PzIV ausf Alfa  This gun had a single-chamber muzzle brake from the 75mm KwK 40 L/43 gun and was mounted in a turret that featured a drum cupola that bulged the turret on the left side.
