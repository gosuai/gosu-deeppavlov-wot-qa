| The miniature (but still large) version of [[T-28]], This tank was given to all players in 2017 Christmas event, Unlike other <small>free garage slot</small> Christmas gift tanks, It can be only sold for a little amount of money (1000 credits). R143 T 29 

If you think that this tank is a waste of garage slots, you should reconsider this. R143 T 29  The T-29 was destined to be "Zerg Rusher" in lower tier matches, since its accuracy is pure comedic, it has to get close enough to enemies in order to be able to land a big punch on them. R143 T 29  But once there, you can use relatively fast speed and ridiculous weight, and size as a deadly weapons against any enemies you see to destroy them either by ramming or using your big gun.

|InTheGame_pros= 
- Decent mobility

- High alpha damage, enough to do two or three shots on most tanks in the same tier

- Very fast reload time (4. R143 T 29 99 seconds with 100% crew) and good DPM

- Heaviest tank in tier 3 (29 tons - 2 times heavier than most tanks in tier 3 game), combined with fast mobility, means it can literally ram with full speed at almost every tank in tier 3 (expect another T-29) or lower and potentially kill them!

- Decent credit maker; earns 10k+ when finished an average match

|InTheGame_cons= 
- Poor armor & large size; easily destroyed if not covered

- Abysmal gun handling that's '''''not much better than that of SPGs' '''''; extremely poor accuracy (especially on the move) with limited gun depression

- Signal range is lackluster and view range mediocre at most

- Poor module health

The T-29 a tier 3 soviet medium tank, and well-known because it was a gift almost everyone could get. R143 T 29  This tank is very capable of dealing damage to enemies, but is unable to hold on a whole flank alone. R143 T 29  But first let's look at the tank. R143 T 29 

The gun is very deadly, high damage, the HE-shells have very high penetration ( slightly less than the AP-rounds ). R143 T 29  The reload time is with a 100% crew around 5 seconds, so this gun also boosts very high DPM. R143 T 29  You are able to 2 or 3 shot your enemies. R143 T 29  But be aware of the accuracy and aim time. R143 T 29  Those values are horrible. R143 T 29  You will have to aim full before you shoot, else you are going to miss most of the time, so be aware. R143 T 29 

Your mobility is quite good. R143 T 29  Your weight is very high, almost 2-3 times heavier then most tier 3 tanks, so ramming is always an option, unless you encounter a another T-29. R143 T 29  The tank is very agile, the reverse speed is good enough for the stats. R143 T 29 

Your armor is unfortunately very bad. R143 T 29  Even light machine-guns are going to penetrate you, so try to use any form of cover, and use your team-mates as main shield. R143 T 29 

Your play-style depends on your match-up. R143 T 29  In a tier 3 battle, you should play aggressive, but only if you are sure you can survive for some time. R143 T 29  Shoot most of the time HE ammunition, so you always deal damage. R143 T 29  Ramming other tanks is a good option, you are able to deal massive damage, you can even kill a full-health tank by ramming! You should always have some team-mates around you, so they can take the damage while you shoot when the enemies are reloading. R143 T 29 

In tier IV the situation is almost the same, but you will meet better armored opponents with deadlier guns. R143 T 29  Always go with your top-tier tanks ( especially tanks like the Pz. R143 T 29  B2 and B1 ) so you have much allies who can take much hits and you can fire reasonable save. R143 T 29
