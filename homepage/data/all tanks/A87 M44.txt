|InTheGame_research=
* None of the available upgrades are researched and carry over from the M41. A87 M44 
* Research the M45 Howitzer 2nd gun first. A87 M44  It is lighter than stock gun so no need for tracks first. A87 M44 
* Research the top radio next, as it is also used on the [[Tank:M53_M55|M53/M55]] later in the line. A87 M44 
* Suspension and engine last. A87 M44  Or you can simply go straight to the [[M12]]. A87 M44 
* Note that the top engine is shared with the [[M41 Walker Bulldog]], [[T49]] and [[T69]] If you are going to be researching these lines in the future it is sensible to research the engine here. A87 M44 

Alternatively, research the suspension first, as you cannot mount the camouflage net without the upgraded suspension. A87 M44  This will allow for increased survivability, while you are researching the other upgrades. A87 M44

|History=
The T99 design was approved in 1947 and development of what would become the M44 began. A87 M44  The design was based upon the chassis of the M41 Walker Bulldog light tank and incorporated the 155mm howitzer M45. A87 M44  Testing during development revealed flaws in the design and production halted. A87 M44  The first 250 vehicles built by Massey Harris had to be rebuilt under the last of a series of revised designs which was designated T194 in 1951. A87 M44  The production models were designated the 155mm self-propelled howitzer M44. A87 M44 [1]
