|The M8A1 is very mobile, which, when combined with its good DPM, absolves the con of low armor. A57 M8A1  Once the crew reaches 100% in Camouflage, the M8A1 is difficult to detect. A57 M8A1  It's meant for support. A57 M8A1  A forward or close combat position, unless fully and well thought out, will result in a quick return to the garage. A57 M8A1  Although the 3-inch AT Gun M7 is a better money maker than the 57 mm, the 57 mm is superior in battle performance due to its greater penetration and higher DPM. A57 M8A1 

|InTheGame_pros=
* Fully traversable turret
* Good mobility
* Good view range
* Good signal range
* Good penetration
* Good DPM (57mm) or alpha (other guns)
* Makes for a painless stock grind since most modules carry over from its predecessor

|InTheGame_cons=
* Open topped turret makes it vulnerable to arty & HE shells
* Weak armor; only protects against small-caliber machine guns (i. A57 M8A1 e. A57 M8A1  [[Tank:G63_PzI_ausf_C|Pz. A57 M8A1  I C]])
* Relatively low hull traverse speed
* Low turret traverse speed
* Lacks the acceleration & view range to be an active scout: but good enough for passive scouting. A57 M8A1

This little tank actually has quite a bit going for it. A57 M8A1  A turret, speed, small profile and an excellent gun. A57 M8A1  The 57mm gun is a good all rounder, making up for its slightly low alpha with a very high rate of fire. A57 M8A1  The long 3-inch gun is also a good choice as well, as its much greater alpha allows a more shoot-and-scoot play style suited to it. A57 M8A1  Both choices are entirely viable, depending on the preferred play style. A57 M8A1 

Speed, and a turret give this tank added flexibility, compared to similar tiered tank destroyers. A57 M8A1   Additionally, it can be quite difficult to spot, especially if you have the Camouflage skill and/or a camouflage net. A57 M8A1  The M8A1 belongs in a supporting role, whittling down opponents who don't know any better, or those that simply can't see you. A57 M8A1  

This tank is considered by many as a "pocket Hellcat" and looks and plays similarly to its tier 6 counterpart. A57 M8A1  Additionally, due to the high skill requirement (no armor to speak of while being very fast and stealthy and not possessing a giant gun), the M8A1 doesn't have the same reputation that a Hetzer does but is arguably a better TD for its tier, able to compete in any game it is placed in.

* The Continental R-975-C1 engine and the 57mm Gun M1 carry over from the [[T56 GMC]] and can be installed immediately. A57 M8A1 
* Research the upgraded suspension first. A57 M8A1 
* Next research the SCR 610 radio. A57 M8A1 
* Go from there. A57 M8A1
