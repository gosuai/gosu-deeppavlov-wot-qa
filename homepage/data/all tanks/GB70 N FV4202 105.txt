|InTheGame_pros= 
*Excellent penetration (on par with the [[Centurion Mk. GB70 N FV4202 105  I]])
*Great gun depression
*Superb accuracy
*The turret forehead achieves auto-bounce angle when engaging enemies from above
*Great terrain resistances (. GB70 N FV4202 105 4/. GB70 N FV4202 105 5/1)

|InTheGame_cons= 
*Thin albeit well angled hull armor (can achieve auto-bounce when angled)
*Turret armor is unreliable even against tier 6 tanks
*Poor alpha damage
*Mediocre rate of fire
*Weak engine with low power to weight ratio (buffed to roughly 15. GB70 N FV4202 105 63 as of 9. GB70 N FV4202 105 20. GB70 N FV4202 105 1)
*Expensive Standard Shells (680 Per Shot)especially compared to other 90mm guns
*Limited Shell Capacity (50 Rounds) often resulting on you being forced to use reserved APCR rounds in good games. GB70 N FV4202 105

The FV4202 is great as a second line sniper, with its high penetration and great accuracy. GB70 N FV4202 105  You can peak over ridges with its great gun depression and often come out better. GB70 N FV4202 105  If you are using the tank's gun depression and only exposing the turret, incoming shots may occasionally ricochet off the forehead due to the steep angle of engagement. GB70 N FV4202 105  It plays like the [[Centurion Mk. GB70 N FV4202 105  I]] but with some differences. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The "cheeks" on the turret will be your downside if you stay still as they are only 85 mm thick and not well sloped. GB70 N FV4202 105  Constantly move back and forth over the ridge to prevent your "cheeks" to be exposed for too long and if the enemy miss or hit the upper turret plate you can punish. GB70 N FV4202 105  Always try to battle in hilly terrain; never flat as your armor won't protect you. GB70 N FV4202 105  Very often and you will receive damage if any gun is pointed towards you if on level ground. GB70 N FV4202 105 

With patch 9. GB70 N FV4202 105 17, it gave the FV4202 an acceptable speed buff of 40 km/h and profitability, and 9. GB70 N FV4202 105 17. GB70 N FV4202 105 1 gave it a good speed of 50 km/h, and patch 9. GB70 N FV4202 105 20. GB70 N FV4202 105 1 increased the engine power from 510 to 650. GB70 N FV4202 105  Unlike the [[Centurion Mk. GB70 N FV4202 105  I]]; which has a stronger engine and hp/t of 16. GB70 N FV4202 105 81 (Fully upgrade, no equipment), the hp/t for the FV4202 is 12. GB70 N FV4202 105 34 (which has since been buffed to about ~15. GB70 N FV4202 105 63 hp/t as of Update 9. GB70 N FV4202 105 20. GB70 N FV4202 105 1). GB70 N FV4202 105  However the FV4202 has the best ground resistances of any Tier VIII mediums (. GB70 N FV4202 105 38/. GB70 N FV4202 105 48/. GB70 N FV4202 105 96) followed close by the [[Panzer 58 Mutz]] and [[T-44-100 (R)]], so while it has a weak engine it has good acceleration and swamp terrain won't affect you as much. GB70 N FV4202 105  So if you managed to find a good spot where you can set up and snipe enemies from afar with your accurate gun, you can make a profit. GB70 N FV4202 105  Always support your team in either Wolf packs or Heavy pushes, aim for the weak spots and drive wheels, it will print credits. GB70 N FV4202 105 

Overall the FV4202 is good crew trainer tank for the Centurions from Tier VIII to Tier X and can be rewarding experience if you keep in mind your weaknesses and strengths. GB70 N FV4202 105 

After the release of Centurion 5/1 and other tier 8 premium tanks, the FV4202 is in desperate need of a buff. GB70 N FV4202 105

|History= 

Towards the mid-1950s, tank designers saw that the current generation of tanks is at an end. GB70 N FV4202 105  Something new and revolutionary had to be done. GB70 N FV4202 105  The 1950s, specifically the latter half, became a time of new creative ideas in the tank design world. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The birthplace of tanks was no exception. GB70 N FV4202 105  The Centurion, the peak of the achievements of British engineers during WWII, was nearing its decline. GB70 N FV4202 105  Three roads were open: one was the creation of a while new tank, another was a deep modernization, the third was an evolutionary step. GB70 N FV4202 105  The third path was seen as the least promising, but it was the one that was chosen. GB70 N FV4202 105  The 105 mm L7 gun's appearance extended the Centurion's life for decades. GB70 N FV4202 105  Even the prototype built in 1945 was still serving somewhere. GB70 N FV4202 105  The result of this modernization was the Centurion Action X that appeared in 1955. GB70 N FV4202 105  The Centurion Mk. GB70 N FV4202 105 7 hull was equipped with a new turret, but the project did not progress past experiments. GB70 N FV4202 105 

As for the creation of a new tank, the first step in this direction was taken in 1956. GB70 N FV4202 105  A tank nicknamed "40 ton Centurion" entered trials. GB70 N FV4202 105  This was an unofficial nickname, of course, the tank's real index was FV4202. GB70 N FV4202 105  Compared with the competitor Medium Gun Tank FV4201, it seemed like a step back. GB70 N FV4202 105  The "predecessor" had an IS-3-like pike with a central position for the driver, and a whole new turret. GB70 N FV4202 105  The FV4202, the vehicle chosen to be built in metal, was a much more conservative evolution of the ideas in the Centurion and Centurion Action X. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The hull was a development of the Centurion, but ended up somewhat lower. GB70 N FV4202 105  Thanks to this, the overall height of the FV4202 was 2. GB70 N FV4202 105 75 meters, a whole quarter of a meter less than the Centurion. GB70 N FV4202 105  The lower hull was used to increase the slant of the upper front plate. GB70 N FV4202 105  The hull was also half a meter shorter, reducing the amount of road wheels to five per side. GB70 N FV4202 105  Thanks to these operations, the mass of the tank decreased from 51 to 40 tons. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The turret was a development of the Action X. GB70 N FV4202 105  The front resembled its predecessor, but had some novelties, like the "beard" underneath the gun mount. GB70 N FV4202 105  The roof also had many common elements. GB70 N FV4202 105  The rear was noticeably different. GB70 N FV4202 105  A late model 20-pounder gun was used. GB70 N FV4202 105  By this time, it got rid of the massive muzzle brake and obtained a fume extractor. GB70 N FV4202 105  Externally, this gun looks similar to the 105 mm L7, which leads to confusion. GB70 N FV4202 105 

Three FV4202s were built. GB70 N FV4202 105  Trials continued for several years, but the tank wasn't given a chance. GB70 N FV4202 105  The evolutionary development of the Centurion was declined and, instead, the FV4201 concept was developed further. GB70 N FV4202 105  By September of 1959, the P1 prototype entered trials, leading to the Chieftain tank family. GB70 N FV4202 105 

One of the FV4202 prototypes was sent to the scrapyard. GB70 N FV4202 105  Another was converted to an ARV, which can be seen in the REME Museum of Technology. GB70 N FV4202 105  The third vehicle ended up in Bovington. GB70 N FV4202 105  Time and a harsh climate did their thing, and the vehicle currently requires a very thorough restoration. GB70 N FV4202 105  Several years ago, the Vehicle Conservation Center was built, which now houses several vehicles that used to be outside, including the FV4202. GB70 N FV4202 105  There is hope that, someday, skilled hands will find their way to this tank, which was a significant, if not well known, point in tank development. GB70 N FV4202 105  Who knows that British tanks would look like if the British would adopt a vehicle that was much smaller than the Centurion, yet equal in protection and firepower. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The tank did not survive to this day in a good shape. GB70 N FV4202 105  The armour skirts, similar to those on the Centurion, are gone, as are much of the fenders. GB70 N FV4202 105  Instead of its own tracks, the tank wears those from late Centurion models. GB70 N FV4202 105  A lot of the stowed equipment is gone, including the headlights and tools. GB70 N FV4202 105  Nevertheless, this is much better than a scrapped tank, but the restoration crews have their work cut out for them. GB70 N FV4202 105 

Despite many similarities, the FV4202's hull differs from that of the Centurion. GB70 N FV4202 105  Most notably, the hull is lower to the ground, allowing the front armour to be placed at a sharper angle. GB70 N FV4202 105  With the same armour thickness, the tank is much better protected than the Centurion, although 80 mm of armour in the late 1950s was not enough, even with this slope. GB70 N FV4202 105 

Like the Centurion, the FV4202's driver is positioned to the right of the tank's axis. GB70 N FV4202 105  The reduction in size did not do wonders for the comfort level, but recall that the Chieftain's driver is practically lying down. GB70 N FV4202 105  Here, the workspace is still more or less acceptable. GB70 N FV4202 105  Unlike the Centurion's two piece hatch, the FV4202's driver hatch lifts and rotates to the side. GB70 N FV4202 105  This is a much more convenient solution. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The suspension migrated from the Centurion Mk. GB70 N FV4202 105 5 with nearly no changes. GB70 N FV4202 105  Of course, "nearly" has a number of nuances. GB70 N FV4202 105  First, the amount of road wheels was reduced to 5. GB70 N FV4202 105  Second, the width of the track links decreased. GB70 N FV4202 105  The tank lost its original tracks, so the second difference is currently gone. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The FV4202 used Horstmann's suspension, which, in various forms, was used on British tanks since 1922. GB70 N FV4202 105  This design was last used on the Chieftain. GB70 N FV4202 105  Despite this rather conservative design, this suspension was satisfactory. GB70 N FV4202 105  However, the issue of removing the bogey in combat conditions was a difficult one. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The rear is similar to the Centurion. GB70 N FV4202 105  Nothing is revolutionary here, just a standard vertical plate. GB70 N FV4202 105  To the left, one can see a field telephone that has been ravaged by vandals, a typical feature on post-war British tanks. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The engine compartment roof is also similar to the Centurion's. GB70 N FV4202 105  One of its features is a multi-part design. GB70 N FV4202 105  This is a very convenient system, even a person without great physical strength can open up the engine compartment on their own. GB70 N FV4202 105  The Americans used a similar system on the Pershing and the Patton, and the Swiss used it on the Panzer 61. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The bottom of British tanks is the pinnacle of minimalism. GB70 N FV4202 105  No hatches here, only a few service openings. GB70 N FV4202 105  If the tank was knocked out, the crew would have to leave under enemy fire. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The turret of the FV4202 has much in common with the Centurion Action X, especially the front. GB70 N FV4202 105  However, there are a series of differences. GB70 N FV4202 105  For example, a "beard" under the gun mantlet, protecting the turret from jamming. GB70 N FV4202 105 

The main armament of the FV4202 is a late model 20-pounder gun. GB70 N FV4202 105  It lacks a muzzle brake, but has a fume extractor to extract gases after firing a shell. GB70 N FV4202 105  From far away, this gun looks like the L7, but close up one can see that the fume extractor shape is different. GB70 N FV4202 105
