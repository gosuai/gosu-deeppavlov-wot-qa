|Overall, the Chaffee is a very powerful Tier V light tank that can take on the scout or flanker role. A34 M24 Chaffee  It can also take out artillery easily with its high DPM, good accuracy, and maneuverability. A34 M24 Chaffee  It is best used for harassing and damaging enemy vehicles, and then moving behind cover, especially in city maps or maps with a lot of cover. A34 M24 Chaffee

|InTheGame_pros=
* Fastest Tier V Light Tank (although just by 2km/h) and also pretty agile
* Excellent view range and camouflage
* Armour can provide some unexpected bounces
* Gun is quick-firing with good alpha damage and excellent DPM
* Easy stock grind

|InTheGame_cons=
* Penetration is somewhat low, but on par with other Tier V light tanks
* Somewhat high profile for its tier. A34 M24 Chaffee 
* Low velocity on the top gun with AP shells makes hitting moving target difficult
* Poor elevation for a light tank of this type. A34 M24 Chaffee 
* Bad accuracy on the top gun

|InTheGame_performance=
The spotting range of the Chaffee is good, making this tank a perfect passive scout. A34 M24 Chaffee  While its 96mm of armor penetration does not compare to the 137mm of penetration it had before or the 170mm of penetration the ELC AMX has, it is comparable to vehicles such as the Leopard. A34 M24 Chaffee  The Gun 75mm M6 and the upgrade, Gun 75mm M17, are welcome upgrades to the 37mm guns the M5 Stuart has. A34 M24 Chaffee  The 75mm gun's versatility is easier to note. A34 M24 Chaffee  Although still insufficient against the front armor of many tanks, it is still more than sufficient for the side and rear armor of heavier vehicles. A34 M24 Chaffee  In addition, it has much-improved alpha and a much larger HE shell, making it far more useful when fighting very lightly armored or heavily armored vehicles. A34 M24 Chaffee  It also has a good continuous rate of fire, meaning that in a light tank melee, it will quickly reduce opposing Tier V lights. A34 M24 Chaffee  As a result, it is highly suggested to get the M17 gun. A34 M24 Chaffee  

However, its armor is much thinner and its silhouette much taller than its contemporaries, and the only real protection afforded to the Chaffee is the gun mantlet and tracks. A34 M24 Chaffee  While these may be able to glance a lucky shot, it should not be counted on, and avoiding damage should be the main objective of staying alive in a Chaffee. A34 M24 Chaffee  The Chaffee can do this by passive scouting. A34 M24 Chaffee  With its small size, light tank camouflage bonus and excellent view range, comparable to Tier IX and Tier X tanks, it can spot entire columns of enemy tanks while remaining hidden, allowing sniping tank destroyers and artillery to demolish the assault column so you can savage the wounded afterwards. A34 M24 Chaffee 

Alternatively, its immense speed and maneuverability allow it to function well as an active scout. A34 M24 Chaffee  Taking little-used side routes, it can quickly sneak its way around battle lines, destroying isolated opponents along the way, such as opposing scouts, tank destroyers, stragglers and artillery. A34 M24 Chaffee  With its view range and radio it can cover large swaths of the battlefield very quickly, detecting advancing or camping opponents and relaying large amounts of information back to the team for strategy to be devised. A34 M24 Chaffee 

Chaffees in the right hands can and will contribute to team victory. A34 M24 Chaffee  Although it lacks the derp power of an ELC AMX or the blistering shredding power of the Leopard, it has a medium tank gun that is superior to even the stock cannon on the Sherman, and is a very flexible light tank. A34 M24 Chaffee  Able to adopt any pressing combat role of a light tank and fulfill it successfully, it is a vehicle whose utility increases towards the end. A34 M24 Chaffee 

|InTheGame_research=
* Both the Wright Continental R-975C-4 engine and the SCR 528 radio transfer over from the artillery line, and the engine is shared with the medium tank line. A34 M24 Chaffee  The radio is also shared with the mid-high tier American TD line. A34 M24 Chaffee  Install these immediately if you have them. A34 M24 Chaffee  
* If you do not have any of these modules, get the engine first, since having powerful engines are vital to light tanks. A34 M24 Chaffee  
* If it was not installed already, research the SCR 528. A34 M24 Chaffee 
* Research the upgraded suspension for additional load capacity and traverse speed. A34 M24 Chaffee 
* Then go for the second turret and the M17 gun. A34 M24 Chaffee 
* Go from there. A34 M24 Chaffee

The Light Tank M24 was an American light tank used during World War II and in postwar conflicts including the Korean War and with the French in the War in Algeria and First Indochina War. A34 M24 Chaffee  In British service it was given the service name Chaffee, after the United States Army General Adna R. A34 M24 Chaffee  Chaffee, Jr. A34 M24 Chaffee , who helped develop the use of tanks in the United States armed forces. A34 M24 Chaffee 

==Development and production history==

Combat experience indicated several shortcomings of the Light Tank M3/M5, the most important of them being weak armament. A34 M24 Chaffee  The T7 design, which was initially seen as a replacement, evolved into a mediocre Medium Tank M7 and was eventually rejected in March 1943, which prompted the Ordnance Committee to issue a specification for a new light tank, with the same powertrain as the M5A1 but armed with a 75 mm gun. A34 M24 Chaffee  In April 1943 the Ordnance Corps together with Cadillac division of General Motors started work on the new project, designated Light Tank T24. A34 M24 Chaffee  Every effort was made to keep the weight of the vehicle under 20 tons. A34 M24 Chaffee  The armor was kept light, with the glacis plate only 25 mm thick (but sloped at 60 degrees from the vertical). A34 M24 Chaffee  A new lightweight 75 mm gun was developed, a derivative of the gun used in the B-25H Mitchell bomber. A34 M24 Chaffee  The gun had the same ballistics as the M3, but used a thinly walled barrel and different recoil mechanism. A34 M24 Chaffee  The design also featured wider (16 inch) tracks and torsion bar suspension. A34 M24 Chaffee  It had relatively low silhouette and a three-man turret. A34 M24 Chaffee  On October 15, 1943 the first pilot vehicle was delivered and production began in 1944 under the designation Light Tank M24. A34 M24 Chaffee  It was produced at two sites; from April at Cadillac and from July at Massey-Harris. A34 M24 Chaffee  By the time production was stopped in August 1945, 4,731 M24s had left the assembly lines. A34 M24 Chaffee  Some of them were supplied to the British forces. A34 M24 Chaffee

The M24 Chaffee was intended to replace the aging and obsolete Light Tank M5 Stuart which was used in supplementary roles. A34 M24 Chaffee  The first thirty-four M24s reached Europe in November 1944 and were issued to the U. A34 M24 Chaffee S. A34 M24 Chaffee  2nd Cavalry Group (Mechanized) in France. A34 M24 Chaffee  These were then issued to F Company, 2nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Battalion and F Company, 42nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Battalion which each received seventeen M24s. A34 M24 Chaffee  During the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, these units and their new tanks were rushed to the southern sector; two of the M24s were detached to serve with the 740th Tank Battalion of the U. A34 M24 Chaffee S. A34 M24 Chaffee  First Army. A34 M24 Chaffee 
The M24 started to enter widespread issue in December 1944 but they were slow in reaching the front-line combat units. A34 M24 Chaffee  By the end of the war many armored divisions were still mainly equipped with the M5. A34 M24 Chaffee  Some armored divisions did not receive their first M24s until the war was over. A34 M24 Chaffee  Reports from the armored divisions that received them prior to the end of hostilities were generally positive. A34 M24 Chaffee  Crews liked the improved off-road performance and reliability, but were most appreciative of the 75 mm main gun, as a vast improvement over the 37 mm. A34 M24 Chaffee  The M24 was not up to the challenge of fighting German tanks, but the bigger gun at least gave its crews a chance to fight back when it was required. A34 M24 Chaffee  The M24's light armor made it vulnerable to virtually all German tanks, anti-tank guns, and hand-held anti-tank weapons. A34 M24 Chaffee  The contribution of the M24 to winning the war in Europe was insignificant, as too few arrived too late to replace the worn-out M5s of the armored divisions. A34 M24 Chaffee  In the Korean War M24s were the first U. A34 M24 Chaffee S. A34 M24 Chaffee  tanks to fight the North Korean T-34-85s. A34 M24 Chaffee  The M24 fared poorly against these much better-armed and armored medium tanks. A34 M24 Chaffee  M24s were more successful later in the war in their reconnaissance role, supported by heavier tanks such as the M4, M26, and M46. A34 M24 Chaffee  Like other successful World War II designs, the M24 was supplied to many armies around the globe and was used in local conflicts long after it had been replaced in the U. A34 M24 Chaffee S. A34 M24 Chaffee  Army by the M41 Walker Bulldog. A34 M24 Chaffee  France employed its M24s in Indo-China in infantry support missions, with good results. A34 M24 Chaffee  They employed ten M24s in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. A34 M24 Chaffee  In December 1953 ten disassembled Chaffees were transported by air to provide fire support to the garrison. A34 M24 Chaffee  They fired about 15,000 shells in the long siege that followed before the Viet Minh forces conquered the camp in May 1954. A34 M24 Chaffee  France also deployed the M24 in Algeria. A34 M24 Chaffee  The last time the M24 is known to have been in action was in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, where some 66 Pakistani Chaffees stationed in Bangladesh were easy prey for Indian Army T-55s, PT-76s, and anti-tank teams. A34 M24 Chaffee  Although both Iran and Iraq had M24s prior to the Iran–Iraq War, there is no report of their use in that conflict. A34 M24 Chaffee

'''Foreign variants'''

[[image:The NM-116. A34 M24 Chaffee jpg|thumb|200px|left|Norwegian modification of the M24 Chaffee under the NM-116 designation]]
- NM-116. A34 M24 Chaffee  In 1972 the Norwegian Army decided to retain 54 of their 123 M24 light tanks as reconnaissance vehicles after they were substantially rebuilt under the designation NM-116. A34 M24 Chaffee  It was calculated that the NM-116 rebuilding program cost only about a third as much as contemporary light tanks. A34 M24 Chaffee  This program was managed by the firm Thune-Eureka. A34 M24 Chaffee  The American firm NAPCO developed an improved power-pack based around the 6V53T diesel engine used in the M113 armored personnel carrier mated to an Allison MT-653 transmission. A34 M24 Chaffee  The original 75 mm Gun M6 L / 39 was replaced with a French D-925 90 mm low pressure gun, with a co-axil M2 . A34 M24 Chaffee 50-caliberheavy machine gun. A34 M24 Chaffee  The bow gunner position was eliminated in favor of ammunition stowage. A34 M24 Chaffee  A new fire control system was installed, complete with a Simrad LV3 laser rangefinder. A34 M24 Chaffee  Norwegian firms also converted eight M24 light tanks into light armored recovery vehicles to support the NM-116. A34 M24 Chaffee  The NM-116 were retired from service in 1993. A34 M24 Chaffee  

- The Chilean Army up-gunned their M24s in the mid-80s to the IMI-OTO 60 mm Hyper Velocity Medium Support (HVMS) gun, with comparable performance to a standard 90 mm gun. A34 M24 Chaffee  Chile operated this version until 1999. A34 M24 Chaffee 

- Uruguay continues to use the M24, modernized with new engines and 76mm guns which can fire armour-piercing, fin stabilised, discarding sabot (or APFSDS) rounds. A34 M24 Chaffee  

- In mid-1950s, in an attempt to improve the anti-tank performance of the vehicle, some French M24s had their turrets replaced with those of the AMX-13 light tank. A34 M24 Chaffee  Interestingly, AMX-13 variant with Chaffee turret also existed. A34 M24 Chaffee
