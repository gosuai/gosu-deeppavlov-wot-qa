|The Conqueror Gun Carriage Or "CGC", nicknamed as the "Conqueror Orbital Laser Carriage," is the final advancement of the British SPG line. GB31 Conqueror Gun  Unlike other SPGs, it is wise to position it closer to the front lines, for several reasons. GB31 Conqueror Gun  First of all, it has short range, and takes a long time to lob its shells to their target location. GB31 Conqueror Gun  However, it is possible to get away with being close to the action due to the Gun Carriage having the best frontal hull armor of any SPG in the game. GB31 Conqueror Gun  Its gun also has monstrous alpha damage and splash radius, giving its shells quite the punch. GB31 Conqueror Gun

The Conqueror GC is much like a buffed, (armour wise), T92 in some ways. GB31 Conqueror Gun  Unfortunately, the gun is worse in all hard statistics except ammunition capacity. GB31 Conqueror Gun   This includes the better armor, as well as H. GB31 Conqueror Gun P. GB31 Conqueror Gun  pool. GB31 Conqueror Gun  However, the gun has shorter range as well as slower shell travel time than other tier X SPG's. GB31 Conqueror Gun  This forces you to get slightly closer to the front lines on larger maps, but this shorter range allows you to reach the maximum range much more easily on most maps, which causes your rounds to fall at steeper angles than other tier X SPG's. GB31 Conqueror Gun   This allows you to land shells behind cover that other artillery pieces would be unable to. GB31 Conqueror Gun   However, the Conqueror Gun Carriage pays for this by having the slowest reloading single-shot gun in the game, requiring you to pick your shots carefully, as you do not have many. GB31 Conqueror Gun   The mobility is acceptable, allowing you to re-position around the battlefield and quickly switch your aim to the other side of the map, but the low top speed of 35 km/h means you can't outrun scouts or mediums that break through. GB31 Conqueror Gun   If forced into T. GB31 Conqueror Gun D. GB31 Conqueror Gun  mode, it is a good idea to set up an ambush. GB31 Conqueror Gun   Scouts and some mediums can also bounce off your upper front plate if they do not aim properly. GB31 Conqueror Gun   Use your H. GB31 Conqueror Gun P. GB31 Conqueror Gun  pool to absorb a shot or two from whatever is shooting you to give your gun more aim time and increase your chance of a hit, because if you miss, you won't get a second shot.

The BL 9. GB31 Conqueror Gun 2 inch Mark II howitzer also had a much higher muzzle velocity than the in-game version at 490m/s; the in-game 360m/s velocity is based on the even older BL 9. GB31 Conqueror Gun 2 inch Mark I that was introduced in 1914 and retired in the 1920s. GB31 Conqueror Gun
