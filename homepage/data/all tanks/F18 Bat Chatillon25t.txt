{{TankData|Tank=Bat. F18 Bat Chatillon25t -Châtillon 25 t}
|Built by Batignolles-Châtillon society at Nantes, the Batignolles-Châtillon 25t, often known in-game as the "Batmobile" or "Batchat", lives up to its reputation as one of the game's best assassin tanks, fit for many roles which include but are not limited to Scout, Sniper (when using the 100 mm SA 47 gun), Flanker, Brawler and Artillery hunter, with a high mobility and powerful gun it's capable of devastating any tank that it encounters. F18 Bat Chatillon25t 

Keep in mind that once your shell drum is depleted (5 or 6 shells, depending on the gun), the gruesome reloading time will make you a very easy prey, and the very thin armor will not save you from any kind of shell as it relies on its mobility as a sort of protection. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  It also has rather poor aim time so you need to get close while moving or stay hidden to fully utilize its awesome cannon. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  While it can hold ground on its own, it is best used on high-risk high-gain encounters in the mid-late part of the round, preferably with another medium tank as support.

The BatChat 25t is as unique as it is capable of delivering incredible burst damage with its 105mm gun, combined with high speed. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  With this gun the tank can, on average, deliver 1950 hp damage in 10. F18 Bat Chatillon25t 73 seconds. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Putting this firepower to use, though, requires a skilled player; as while the Bat may be capable of doing immense damage, it is not very capable of taking it. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  It has the lowest HP of any tier X tank, and its armor is virtually nonexistent. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  It can survive two or three hits on average. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Another thing to note is that the Batchat is the lightest tier X weighing in at only 25 tons, so avoid ramming enemies. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Its standard ammunition is APCR for the top gun. F18 Bat Chatillon25t 

Like other autoloaders, the batchat is a favorite target due to its combination of high burst damage and soft armor. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  A batchat should use its combination of speed burst to find vulnerable opponents and avoid unfavorable encounters. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Skilled opponents are able to count the number of shots a Batchat has fired in close engagements, so it is important to reload whenever the opportunity presents itself and have an escape route planned at all times. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  

The Batchat really comes into its own during the mid-game and late-game, especially if it still has a substantial amount of hitpoints left. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  By this stage, enemy positions should be known and many tanks will already have taken damage and have spread out across the map. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  The Bat excels in "pouncing" on these lone and/or wounded enemy tanks, since it has both the speed to chase them down and the firepower to finish them off before they can do much in return. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  These qualities are also very useful when using the Bat as an artillery hunter: even [[Bat Chatillon 155|the artillery piece]] based on this tank cannot outrun it forever and one drum contains enough firepower to finish off two tier X artillery pieces, or even more lower tier ones. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  The fun doesn't last forever, though: the Batchat only carries 30 rounds of ammunition and they can run out quickly if you let them go to waste by missing or bouncing shots. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Like all other autoloader tanks, it is absolutely critical to make every shot count. F18 Bat Chatillon25t

|History=
[[image:Batignolles-Chatillon 25t. F18 Bat Chatillon25t jpg|thumb|200px|left|Batignolles-Chatillon 25t a prototype that almost revived the concept of modern medium tank]]
In the beginning of the fifties, development of the very effective HEAT ammunition which basically negated the (homogeneous steel) armor of existing heavy tanks, for the moment revived the idea of medium tanks. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Batignolles-Châtillon, renowned manufacturer of railway cars and locomotives, started the development of a new medium tank that eventually evolved into an “as light as possible” main battle tank concept. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Batignolles-Châtillon's Char 25t had a very flat hull, with 80 mm of highly sloped front armor, hydraulic suspension with six wheels and a oscillating tower. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  

== Oscillating Turret ==
The oscillating turret design, lacking a conventional gun-mantlet, is in two separate parts, with an upper and lower part connected by two hinge bolts or pivots, the gun being fixed within the upper section. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  The horizontal movement of the gun (traversing) is conventional, but the vertical movement (elevation) is achieved through the pivoting of the entire upper section with respect to the lower section. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  This method of elevation has two main advantages. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Firstly, it allows for a smaller turret volume, as no internal space is needed for the vertical movement of the gun breech. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Secondly, it allows the use of a relatively simple auto-loader fed by multi-round magazines, [[image:Batignolles-Chatillon 25t close up of the oscillating tower. F18 Bat Chatillon25t jpg|thumb|200px|right|Batignolles-Châtillon 25t close up of the oscillating turret]]achieving a very high rate of fire as the gun's position was fixed with respect to the auto-loader located in the back of the upper turret in a protruding bustle. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  The oscillating turret was a very fashionable concept in the fifties, and also applied in some American projects, such as the T57 and T58. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Only the French, however, produced operational systems. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  

== Armament And Other Design Features ==
Main armament consisted of a powerful 90 mm gun, with initial muzzle velocity of 930 m/s. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  As a secondary armament, the Char 25t had a single 7,5 mm machine gun. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  With very compact dimensions of only 5. F18 Bat Chatillon25t 67m in length, 3. F18 Bat Chatillon25t 16m in width, and 2. F18 Bat Chatillon25t 37m in height, mass of the vehicle stayed below 25 tones. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  With such a low weight, the Char 25t could achieve a very high top speed of 65 km/h. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  The crew consisted of four; a commander and gunner placed in the turret, while the driver and radio operator were placed in the hull. F18 Bat Chatillon25t

== Fate == 
Batignolles-Châtillon Char 25t lost the competition for the next French main battle tank in favor of the AMX 30, mainly because of an unreliable and maintenance intensive hydraulic suspension, as well as fading interest in the oscillating turret concept. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  It was relatively tall (compared to its size) and it was very difficult to make it gas tight. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  In the era of cold war with a high risk of nuclear and chemical warfare, this was considered a major flaw. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  However, some of the technology was used in later vehicles. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  

Two prototypes were built. F18 Bat Chatillon25t

All of the Batchat's current armament configurations are fake. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Only the [[Gun/France#90 mm DCA 45|90 mm DCA 45]] was equipped on the tank, and it still exists on the prototype today. F18 Bat Chatillon25t  Additionally, the [[Gun/France#75 mm SA50|75 mm SA50]] gun was planned for the initial version of the tank in 1948. F18 Bat Chatillon25t
