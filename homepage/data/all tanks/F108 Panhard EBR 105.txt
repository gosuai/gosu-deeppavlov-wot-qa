|Currently the fastest vehicle in '''''World of Tanks'''''. F108 Panhard EBR 105   The Panhard EBR 105 features insane mobility that surpasses any tanks that were ever added in the game, with a whopping speed of 91km/h in rapid mode. F108 Panhard EBR 105  In the Common Test when the wheeled vehicles were unveiled, the EBR 105 had been able to achieve more than 100 km/h (105 km/h was the listed top speed)!  Although its penetration and protection are underwhelming it can utilize its mobility to harass its targets and bring them down one by one. F108 Panhard EBR 105 

|Gallery= 

|InTheGame_pros= 
- Highest top speed in the game (91km/h in rapid mode), its top speed in normal mode is also very fast as well (70km/h)

- Wheeled vehicle: very high reverse speed, and requires hitting 5 out of 8 wheels or disabling its engine to force the vehicle to stop. F108 Panhard EBR 105 

- APCR provides very high shell velocity (1300m/s), allowing it to hit moving targets with ease

- Insane turret traverse speed and very low aim time, combined with "special target locking", means it can snap shot very effectively

- Excellent Camouflage values, great gun handling

- High pen on its HE round 

|InTheGame_cons= 
- Lowest HP of all tier X non-SPGs (1300) as well as having a larger but much weaker turret than its predecessor; extremely vulnerable to HE shells

- Lowest penetration of all non-derp guns at tier X, and also one of the most hated vehicles - priority target

- Wheeled vehicle  -- cannot rotate the hull while stationary, and when any wheel(s) are damaged its speed deteriorates significantly

- Low ammo capacity (36 rounds)

- Poor DPM due to relatively long reload time (12 seconds)

- Low view range (350m)

- Very low weight (17 tons) -- extremely prone to ramming

- High chance of catching fire (15%) -- second score of all tier X light tanks

|InTheGame_performance= 
To start off, the EBR 105 is already recognized as one of the strongest vehicles in the game currently, although it is a little less powerful due to the nerfs from Update 1. F108 Panhard EBR 105 10. F108 Panhard EBR 105 

Its cannon has mediocre penetration, and low DPM, but it makes up for this in other ways. F108 Panhard EBR 105  For one, its gun handling is absolutely fantastic for a Light Tank even after the nerfs (0. F108 Panhard EBR 105 08/0. F108 Panhard EBR 105 08/0. F108 Panhard EBR 105 04; it was 0. F108 Panhard EBR 105 06/0. F108 Panhard EBR 105 06/0. F108 Panhard EBR 105 03 before Update 1. F108 Panhard EBR 105 10) and has a HE round comparable to HESH (105 pen instead of the normal 53). F108 Panhard EBR 105  Combined with the almost decent dispersion for a Light (0. F108 Panhard EBR 105 36 with a 100% crew) it can snipe and snapshot very well. F108 Panhard EBR 105  It additionally has a special "auto-aim" feature that is essentially an enhanced version of the regular auto-aim; due to its very high speed, the EBR 105 does not have to directly highlight a vehicle to autoaim, which is especially useful at range. F108 Panhard EBR 105  Even the [[Leopard 1]] cannot snapshot quite as reliably, although it is far more accurate when fully aimed. F108 Panhard EBR 105 

Although the majority of Light tanks do not have good survivability, the EBR 105 has some notable traits that mitigate this somewhat. F108 Panhard EBR 105  For one, wheels cover a very large chunk of both of its sides, which sometimes block shots and also prevent it from getting tracked like any normal vehicle. F108 Panhard EBR 105  It also has stupidly high camouflage values for its size (higher than the [[Manticore]]. F108 Panhard EBR 105 

Possibly its strongest aspect, however, is its mobility; it has a very high top speed in Rapid Mode of 91/65 (forward/reverse) and decent Cruise Mode (70/50). F108 Panhard EBR 105  Combined with its ability to do extreme turns without losing much of its speed, it is capable of dodging a huge amount of shots virtually any other tank would have been hit by. F108 Panhard EBR 105  Combined with its great gun handling, it can get away with drive-by's or scouting a sniper nest, if done properly. F108 Panhard EBR 105  The mobility, high camo, gun handling and high HE pen also let it hunt artillery very well. F108 Panhard EBR 105  Additionally, like most other wheeled vehicles, it has the property that it can do a stupidly sharp turn; if using the A or D key to turn, the W or S key can briefly be let off to do a very sharp turn, which amplifies further if at top speed and switching to Cruise Mode at the same time. F108 Panhard EBR 105  The mobility can be compared to the old version of the [[T-50-2]] that went 72 km/h, or the [[AMX ELC bis]] before it was nerfed, or perhaps the [[Pz. F108 Panhard EBR 105 Kpfw. F108 Panhard EBR 105  I Ausf. F108 Panhard EBR 105  C]]. F108 Panhard EBR 105 

However, it does have some major weaknesses that prevent it from being completely overpowered (although it is still near universally considered broken or game-breaking). F108 Panhard EBR 105  Although it has a high speed that lets it flank for side shots quite well, its standard and premium penetration are still low (190/240), so a large chunk of same-tier tanks are able to take the shots head-on frontally and take no damage. F108 Panhard EBR 105  Additionally, the low Rate of Fire prevents it from reliably engaging targets one-on-one without them being either poorly armored to use HE (110 average damage increase) or on low health. F108 Panhard EBR 105 

Additionally, although its mobility may well be its biggest upside, it also can be its biggest downside; it can be very hard to control it initially, and takes a fair amount of time to drive properly without bouncing off rocks or taking massive collision damage. F108 Panhard EBR 105 

Another thing is although its survivability is above-average for a Light tank, skilled tankers can still obliterate a bad driver, especially if it is a tank with high shell velocity and decent gun handling. F108 Panhard EBR 105  The survivability also is largely luck-based, as a shot that hits the wheels typically is one that dispersed into it rather than into the hull. F108 Panhard EBR 105 

The scouting also has its limits; although its camouflage value is excellent, its view range is terrible (340 meters). F108 Panhard EBR 105  It cannot be boosted past 445 meters (the cap of the range vehicles can be spotted at is 445 meters) without food (the absolute max without food is 443 meters with bond vents, bond optics, brothers in arms, recon and situational awareness, as well as optics directive). F108 Panhard EBR 105  Many players may not be able to achieve it even with food, but it is also an expensive loadout that is not affordable for many. F108 Panhard EBR 105 

Lastly, it is a difficult tank to play properly, as a single mistake can send the driver straight to the garage. F108 Panhard EBR 105  It is also a priority target due to the potential it has, and also because of how hated it is, especially when it comes to flushing out artillery or Tank Destroyers. F108 Panhard EBR 105  Although it is very difficult for an artillery to hit one reliably, the EBR 105 and other wheeled lights still often get focused by them, due to the chance of a full penetration and thus massive damage or a flat-out oneshot. F108 Panhard EBR 105  

Overall, the EBR 105 is a great Light tank/Wheeled vehicle, if not borderline overpowered*, but make no mistake; it is not fool-proof. F108 Panhard EBR 105  It is a difficult vehicle to play properly, and poor performance will show. F108 Panhard EBR 105  *It may be nerfed a second time, depending on how well Wargaming feels it is balanced. F108 Panhard EBR 105

The Panhard EBR 105 is an unhistorical configuration of the Panhard EBR with a modified ERC 90 Sagaie retrofitted turret, recognizable with the yellow warning sticker for the laser rangefinder and the boxy gunner sight offering both day and night vision. F108 Panhard EBR 105  The ERC is armed with a 90 mm gun firing APFSDS and HEAT. F108 Panhard EBR 105  France started mass-producing the ERC 90 in the mid 70s, and has recently retired them from active service (although they are still used for training purposes), having replaced them with AMX 10 RCR wheeled reconnaissance tanks.
