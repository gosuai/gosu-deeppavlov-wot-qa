|History= 
The success of German and Soviet heavy tanks, like [[Tiger II]] and [[IS-2]] (and also IS-3) excited French tank engineers and would literally not let them stay put. F19 Lorraine40t  They were inspired, as was expected, by German and Soviet heavy tanks. F19 Lorraine40t  The French engineers had developed several new tank models. F19 Lorraine40t  Of course, they were neither the biggest, nor the heaviest examples, but ended up being quite spectacular armored vehicles nevertheless. F19 Lorraine40t  It is likely that not only the glorious armor, but also firepower of the aforementioned steel monsters, being produced in Germany and USSR, became the source of the fixed idea of installing 100-mm (for starters) and then even 120-mm caliber guns. F19 Lorraine40t  However, almost all of the produced tank projects would either, for one reason or another, had stayed in production for an indefinite amount of time or be made in limited quantities. F19 Lorraine40t  As far as is known, almost all experimental machines used the German engine Maybach as a power source. F19 Lorraine40t  As sad as it might be, the largest part of the French tank forces in that period was issued with “Sherman”, M-26, M-24 and also “Panther” tanks. F19 Lorraine40t  Lorraine 40t had never left the testing phase, only two prototypes would be produced. F19 Lorraine40t  Actually, this combat vehicle was a lighter version of the AMH-50 heavy tank, but some interesting construction solutions would distinct it from the others. F19 Lorraine40t  Unlike it’s post-war predecessors (in this branch), the tower of this tank was installed inside of the front part of the body. F19 Lorraine40t  Also, the tank had another characteristic – “pike nose”, like IS-3. F19 Lorraine40t  It’s worth mentioning the rubber tires on the wheels of the running gear for added amortization.
