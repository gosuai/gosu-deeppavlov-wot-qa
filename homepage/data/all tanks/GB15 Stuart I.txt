|The tier III light tank of the British Lend-Lease line, the Stuart I-IV will give you the same things you felt from the British [[M2]]; something much more sluggish than the American version. GB15 Stuart I  The main difference is the 2-pdr cannon you receive, making this LT much more suited for trading shots and supporting the main force, rather than charging head on like the [[M3 Stuart]].

|History=
The British Army was the first to use the Light Tank M3 as the "General Stuart" in combat. GB15 Stuart I  From mid-November 1941 to the end of the year, about 170 Stuarts (in a total force of over 700 tanks) took part in Operation Crusader during the North Africa Campaign, with poor results. GB15 Stuart I  Although the high losses suffered by Stuart-equipped units during the operation had more to do with better tactics and training of the Afrika Korps than the apparent superiority of German armored fighting vehicles used in the North African campaign, the operation revealed that the M3 had several technical faults. GB15 Stuart I  Mentioned in the British complaints were the 37 mm M5 gun and poor internal layout. GB15 Stuart I  The two-man turret crew was a significant weakness, and some British units tried to fight with three-man turret crews. GB15 Stuart I  The Stuart also had a limited range, which was a severe problem in the highly mobile desert warfare as units often outpaced their supplies and were stranded when they ran out of fuel. GB15 Stuart I  On the positive side, crews liked its relatively high speed and mechanical reliability. GB15 Stuart I  The high reliability distinguished the Stuart from cruiser tanks of the period, in particular the Crusader, which composed a large portion of the British tank force in Africa up until 1942.
